 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The narrative which this evangelist gives us (or rather God by him) of 
 the life of Christ begins earlier than either Matthew or Mark. We have 
 reason to thank God for them all, as we have for all the gifts and 
 graces of Christ's ministers, which in one make up what is wanting in 
 the other, while all put together make a harmony. In this chapter we 
 have, 

 I. Luke's preface to his gospel, or his epistle dedicatory to his
 friend Theophilus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The prophecy and history of the conception of John Baptist, who was 
 Christ's forerunner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:5-25">ver. 5-25</A>.

 The annunciation of the virgin Mary, or the notice given to her that 
 she should be the mother of the Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:26-38">ver. 26-38</A>.

 IV. The interview between Mary the mother of Jesus and Elisabeth the 
 mother of John, when they were both with child of those pregnant 
 births, and the prophecies they both uttered upon that occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:39-56">ver. 39-56</A>.

 V. The birth and circumcision of John Baptist, six months before the
 birth of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:57-66">ver. 57-66</A>.

 VI. Zacharias's song of praise, in thankfulness for the birth of John, 
 and in prospect of the birth of Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:67-79">ver. 67-79</A>.

 VII. A short account of John Baptist's infancy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:80">ver. 80</A>.

 And these do more than give us an entertaining narrative; they will 
 lead us into the understanding of the mystery of godliness, God 
 manifest in the flesh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
 declaration of those things which are most surely believed among
 us,
 &nbsp; 2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning
 were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
 &nbsp; 3 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding
 of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order,
 most excellent Theophilus,
 &nbsp; 4 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things,
 wherein thou hast been instructed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Complimental prefaces and dedications, the language of flattery and the 
 food and fuel of pride, are justly condemned by the wise and good; but 
 it doth not therefore follow, that such as are useful and instructive 
 are to be run down; such is this, in which St. Luke dedicates his 
 gospel to his friend Theophilus, not as to his <I>patron,</I> though he 
 was a man of honour, to protect it, but as to his <I>pupil,</I> to 
 learn it, and hold it fast. It is not certain who this Theophilus was; 
 the name signifies a <I>friend of God;</I> some think that it does not 
 mean any particular person, but every one that is a <I>lover of 
 God;</I> Dr. Hammond quotes some of the ancients understanding it so: 
 and then it teaches us, that those who are truly lovers of God, will 
 heartily welcome the gospel of Christ, the design and tendency of which 
 are, to bring us to God. But it is rather to be understood of some 
 particular person, probably a magistrate; because Luke gives him here 
 the same title of respect which St. Paul gave to Festus the governor, 
 <B><I>kratiste</I></B> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:25">Acts xxvi. 25</A>),

 which we there translate <I>most noble Festus,</I> and here <I>most 
 excellent Theophilus.</I> Note, Religion does not destroy civility and 
 good manners, but teaches us, according to the usages of our country, 
 to <I>give honour to them to whom honour is due.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now observe here, 

 I. Why St. Luke wrote this gospel. It is certain that he was moved by 
 the Holy Ghost, not only <I>to</I> the writing, but <I>in</I> the 
 writing of it; but in both he was moved as a reasonable creature, and 
 not as a mere machine; and he was made to consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the things he wrote of were things that were <I>most surely 
 believed among all Christians,</I> and therefore things which they 
 ought to be instructed in, that they may know what they believe, and 
 things which ought to be transmitted to posterity (who are as much 
 concerned in them as we are); and, in order to that, to be committed to 
 writing, which is the surest way of conveyance to the ages to come. He 
 will not write about things of <I>doubtful disputation,</I> things 
 about which Christians may safely differ from one another and hesitate 
 within themselves; but the things which are, and ought to be, most 
 <I>surely believed,</I> <B><I>pragmata peplerophoremena</I></B>--<I>the
 things which were performed</I> (so some), which Christ and his 
 apostles did, and did with such circumstances as gave a full assurance 
 that they were really done, so that they have gained an established 
 lasting credit. Note, Though it is not the foundation of our faith, yet 
 it is a support to it, that the articles of our creed are things that 
 have been long <I>most surely believed.</I> The doctrine of Christ is 
 what thousands of the wisest and best of men have <I>ventured their 
 souls upon</I> with the greatest assurance and satisfaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That it was requisite there should be a <I>declaration made in 
 order</I> of those things; that the history of the life of Christ 
 should be <I>methodized,</I> and committed to writing, for the greater 
 certainty of the conveyance. When things are <I>put in order,</I> we 
 know the better where to <I>find them</I> for <I>our own</I> use, and 
 how to <I>keep</I> them for the benefit of <I>others.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That there were <I>many who had undertaken</I> to <I>publish</I> 
 narratives of the <I>life of Christ,</I> many well-meaning people, who 
 <I>designed</I> well, and <I>did</I> well, and what they published had 
 <I>done good,</I> though not done by divine inspiration, nor so well 
 done as might be, nor intended for perpetuity. Note, 

 (1.) The labours of others in the gospel of Christ, if faithful and 
 honest, we ought to <I>commend</I> and <I>encourage,</I> and not to 
 <I>despise,</I> though chargeable with many deficiencies. 

 (2.) Others' services to Christ must not be reckoned to supersede ours, 
 but rather to quicken them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That the truth of the things he had to write was <I>confirmed</I> by 
 the <I>concurring testimony</I> of those who were competent and 
 unexceptionable witnesses of them; what had been published in writing 
 already, and what he was now about to publish, agreed with that which 
 had been delivered by word of mouth, over and over, by those who from 
 the beginning were <I>eye-witnesses and ministers of the word,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) The apostles were <I>ministers of the word</I> of Christ, who is
 <I>the Word</I> (so some understand it), or of the doctrine of Christ; 
 they, having received it themselves, ministered it to others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John i. 1</A>.

 They had not a gospel to make as masters, but a gospel to preach as
 ministers.

 (2.) The <I>ministers of the word</I> were <I>eye-witnesses</I> of the 
 things which they preached, and, which is also included, 
 <I>ear-witnesses.</I> They did themselves <I>hear</I> the doctrine of 
 Christ, and <I>see</I> his miracles, and had them not by report, at 
 second hand; and therefore they could not but speak, with the greatest 
 assurance, the things which they had <I>seen and heard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:20">Acts iv. 20</A>.
 
 (3.) They were so <I>from the beginning</I> of Christ's ministry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 He had his disciples with him when he wrought his <I>first miracle,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:11">John ii. 11</A>.

 They <I>companied with him all the time he went in and out among
 them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:21">Acts i. 21</A>),

 so that they not only heard and saw all that which was sufficient to 
 confirm their faith, but, if there had been any thing to shock it, they 
 had opportunity to discover it. 

 (4.) The <I>written</I> gospel, which we have to <I>this day,</I> 
 exactly agrees with the gospel which was <I>preached</I> in the 
 <I>first days</I> of the church. 

 (5.) That he himself had a <I>perfect understanding</I> of the 
 <I>things</I> he wrote of, <I>from the first,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Some think that here is a tacit reflection upon those who had written 
 before him, that they had not a <I>perfect understanding</I> of what 
 they wrote, and therefore, <I>Here am I, send me (--facit indignatio 
 versum--my wrath impels my pen</I>); or rather, without reflecting on 
 them, he asserts his own ability for this undertaking: "It seemed good 
 to me, having attained to the exact knowledge of all things, 
 <B><I>anothen</I></B>--<I>from above;</I>" so I think it should be 
 rendered; for if he meant the same with <I>from the beginning</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 as our translation intimates, he would have used the same word.

 [1.] He had diligently <I>searched</I> into these things, had 
 <I>followed</I> after them (so the word is), as the Old-Testament 
 prophets are said to have <I>enquired</I> and <I>searched 
 diligently,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10">1 Pet. i. 10</A>.

 He had not taken things so easily and superficially as others who had
 written before him, but made it his business to inform himself 
 concerning particulars.

 [2.] He had received his intelligence, not only by tradition, as others 
 had done, but by revelation, confirming that tradition, and securing 
 him from any error or mistake in the recording of it. He sought it 
 <I>from above</I> (so the word intimates), and from thence he had it; 
 thus, like Elihu, he <I>fetched his knowledge</I> from afar. He wrote 
 his history as Moses wrote his, of things <I>reported</I> by tradition, 
 but <I>ratified</I> by inspiration. 

 [3.] He could therefore say that he had a <I>perfect understanding</I> 
 of these things. He knew them, 
 <B><I>akribos</I></B>--<I>accurately,</I> exactly. "Now, having 
 received this <I>from above,</I> it seemed good to me to communicate 
 it;" for such a talent as this ought not to be buried.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Observe why he sent it to <I>Theophilus:</I> "I wrote unto thee 
 these things <I>in order,</I> not that thou mayest give reputation to 
 the work, but that thou mayest be edified by it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 <I>that thou mayest know the certainty of those things wherein thou has 
 been instructed.</I>" 

 1. It is implied, that he had been <I>instructed</I> in these things 
 either before his baptism, or since, or both, according to the rule, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19,20">Matt. xxviii. 19, 20</A>.

 Probably, Luke had baptized him, and knew how well instructed he was;
 <B><I>peri hon katechethes</I></B>--<I>concerning which thou hast been 
 catechized;</I> so the word is; the most knowing Christians began with 
 being catechized. Theophilus was a person of quality, perhaps of noble 
 birth; and so much the more pains should be taken with such when they 
 are young, to teach them the principles of the oracles of God, that 
 they may be fortified against temptations, and furnished for the 
 opportunities, of a high condition in the world. 

 2. It was intended that he should <I>know the certainty of those
 things,</I> should understand them more clearly and believe more 
 firmly. There is a <I>certainty</I> in the gospel of Christ, there is 
 that therein which we may build upon; and those who have been well 
 instructed in the things of God when they were young should afterwards 
 give diligence to <I>know the certainty</I> of those things, to know 
 not only what we believe, but why we believe it, that we may be able to 
 give a <I>reason of the hope that is in us.</I></P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  There was in the days of Herod, the king of Jud&aelig;a, a certain
 priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife <I>was</I>
 of the daughters of Aaron, and her name <I>was</I> Elisabeth.
 &nbsp; 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
 commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
 &nbsp; 7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and
 they both were <I>now</I> well stricken in years.
 &nbsp; 8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's
 office before God in the order of his course,
 &nbsp; 9 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was
 to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
 &nbsp; 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without
 at the time of incense.
 &nbsp; 11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on
 the right side of the altar of incense.
 &nbsp; 12 And when Zacharias saw <I>him,</I> he was troubled, and fear fell
 upon him.
 &nbsp; 13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy
 prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
 and thou shalt call his name John.
 &nbsp; 14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
 at his birth.
 &nbsp; 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
 drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with
 the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
 &nbsp; 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
 their God.
 &nbsp; 17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
 to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the
 disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people
 prepared for the Lord.
 &nbsp; 18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know
 this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
 &nbsp; 19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
 stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and
 to show thee these glad tidings.
 &nbsp; 20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak,
 until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou
 believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
 &nbsp; 21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
 tarried so long in the temple.
 &nbsp; 22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
 perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he
 beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.
 &nbsp; 23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his
 ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
 &nbsp; 24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
 herself five months, saying,
 &nbsp; 25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he
 looked on <I>me,</I> to take away my reproach among men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The two preceding evangelists had agreed to begin the gospel with the 
 baptism of John and his ministry, which commenced about six months 
 before our Saviour's public ministry (and now, things being near a 
 crisis, six months was <I>a deal</I> of time, which before was but <I>a 
 little</I>), and therefore this evangelist, designing to give a more 
 particular account than had been given of our Saviour's conception and 
 birth, determines to do so of John Baptist, who in both was his 
 harbinger and forerunner, the morning-star to the Sun of righteousness. 
 The evangelist determines thus, not only because it is commonly 
 reckoned a satisfaction and entertainment to know something of the 
 original extraction and early days of those who afterwards prove great 
 men, but because in the beginning of these there were many things 
 miraculous, and presages of what they afterwards proved. In these 
 verses our inspired historian begins as early as the conception of John 
 Baptist. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The account given of <I>his parents</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 They lived <I>in the days of Herod the king,</I> who was a foreigner, 
 and a deputy for the Romans, who had lately made Judea a province of 
 the empire. This is taken notice of to show that the sceptre was quite 
 departed from Judah, and therefore that now was the time for Shiloh to 
 come, according to Jacob's prophecy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.

 The family of David was now sunk, when it was to rise, and flourish
 again, in the Messiah. Note, None ought to despair of the reviving and
 flourishing of religion, even when civil liberties are lost. Israel 
 enslaved, yet then comes the glory of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the father of John Baptist was a priest, a son of Aaron; his name 
 <I>Zacharias.</I> No families in the world were ever so honoured of God 
 as those of Aaron and David; with one was made the covenant of 
 priesthood, with the other that of royalty; they had both forfeited 
 their honour, yet the gospel again puts honour upon both in their 
 latter days, on that of Aaron in John Baptist, on that of David in 
 Christ, and then they were both extinguished and lost. Christ was of 
 David's house, his forerunner of Aaron's; for his priestly agency and 
 influence opened the way to his kingly authority and dignity. This 
 Zacharias was <I>of the course of Abia.</I> When in David's time the 
 family of Aaron was multiplied, he divided them into twenty-four 
 courses, for the more regular performances of their office, that it 
 might never be either <I>neglected</I> for want of hands or 
 <I>engrossed</I> by a few. The eighth of those was that of <I>Abia</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+24:10">1 Chron. xxiv. 10</A>),

 who was descended from Eleazar, Aaron's eldest son; but Dr. Lightfoot 
 suggests that many of the families of the priests were lost in the 
 captivity, so that after their return they took in those of other 
 families, retaining the names of the heads of the respective courses. 
 The wife of this Zacharias was of the daughters of Aaron too, and her 
 name was <I>Elisabeth,</I> the very same name with <I>Elisheba</I> the 
 wife of Aaron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:23">Exod. vi. 23</A>.

 The priests (Josephus saith) was very careful to marry within their own
 family, that they might maintain the dignity of the priesthood and keep 
 it without mixture.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now that which is observed concerning Zacharias and Elisabeth is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they were a very religious couple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>They were both righteous before God;</I> they were so in his sight 
 whose judgment, we are sure, is <I>according to truth;</I> they were 
 sincerely and really so. They are righteous indeed that are so 
 <I>before God,</I> as Noah in his generation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:1">Gen. vii. 1</A>.

 They <I>approved</I> themselves <I>to him,</I> and he was graciously
 pleased to accept them. It is a happy thing when those who are joined 
 to each other in marriage are both <I>joined to the Lord;</I> and it is 
 especially requisite that the priests, the Lord's ministers, should 
 with their yoke-fellows be <I>righteous before God,</I> that they may 
 be <I>examples to the flock,</I> and rejoice their hearts. <I>They 
 walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, 
 blameless.</I>

 (1.) Their being <I>righteous before God</I> was evidenced by the 
 course and tenour of their conversations; they showed it, not by their 
 talk, but by their <I>works;</I> by the way they walked in and the rule 
 they walked by. 

 (2.) They were <I>of a piece</I> with themselves; for their devotions 
 and their conversations agreed. They walked not only in the
 <I>ordinances</I> of the Lord, which related to divine worship, but in 
 the <I>commandments</I> of the Lord, which have reference to all the 
 instances of a good conversation, and must be regarded. 

 (3.) They were universal in their obedience; not that they never did in 
 any thing <I>come short</I> of their duty, but it was their constant 
 care and endeavor to <I>come up</I> to it. 

 (4.) Herein, though they were not <I>sinless,</I> yet they were 
 <I>blameless;</I> nobody could charge them with any open scandalous 
 sin; they lived <I>honestly</I> and <I>inoffensively,</I> as ministers 
 and their families are in a special manner concerned to do, that the 
 ministry be not blamed in <I>their</I> blame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they had been long <I>childless,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Children are a <I>heritage of the Lord.</I> But there are many of his
 heirs in a married state, that yet are denied this <I>heritage;</I>
 they are valuable desirable blessings; yet many there are, who are
 <I>righteous before God,</I> and, if they had children, would bring
 them up in his fear, who yet are not thus blessed, while the <I>men of
 this world</I> are <I>full of children</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>),

 <I>and send forth their little ones like a flock,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:11">Job xxi. 11</A>.
 
 Elisabeth was <I>barren,</I> and they began to despair of ever having
 children, for they were both now <I>well stricken in years,</I> when
 the women that have been most fruitful <I>leave off bearing.</I> Many
 eminent persons were born of mothers that had been long childless, as 
 Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Samson, Samuel, and so here John Baptist, to make 
 their birth the more remarkable and the blessing of it the more 
 valuable to their parents, and to show that when God keeps his people 
 long waiting for mercy he sometimes is pleased to recompense them for 
 their patience by <I>doubling</I> the worth of it when it comes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The appearing of an angel to his father Zacharias, as he was 
 ministering in the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:8-11"><I>v.</I> 8-11</A>.

 Zechariah the prophet was the last of the Old Testament that was 
 conversant with angels, and Zacharias the priest the first in the New 
 Testament. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How Zacharias was employed in the service of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 He <I>executed the priest's office, before God, in the order of his 
 course;</I> it was his <I>week of waiting,</I> and he was <I>upon 
 duty.</I> Though his family was not built up, or made to grow, yet he 
 made conscience of doing the work of his own place and day. Though we 
 have not <I>desired mercies,</I> yet we must keep close to <I>enjoined 
 services;</I> and, in our diligent and constant attendance on them, we 
 may hope that mercy and comfort will come at last. Now it fell to 
 Zacharias's lot to burn incense morning and evening for that week of 
 his waiting, as other services fell to other priests <I>by lot</I> 
 likewise. The services were directed by lot, that some might not 
 decline them and others engross them, and that, the <I>disposal of the 
 lot</I> being <I>from the Lord,</I> they might have the satisfaction of 
 a divine call to the work. This was not the high priest burning incense 
 on the day of atonement, as some have fondly imagined, who have thought 
 by that to find out the time of our Saviour's birth; but it is plain 
 that it was the burning of the daily incense at the <I>altar of 
 incense</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 which was <I>in the temple</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 not in the most holy place, into which the high priest entered. The 
 Jews say that one and the same priest burned not incense twice in all 
 his days (there were such a multitude of them), at least never more 
 than one week. It is very probable that this was <I>upon the sabbath 
 day,</I> because there was a <I>multitude of people</I> attending 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 which ordinarily was not on a week day; and thus God usually puts 
 honour upon <I>his own day.</I> And then if Dr. Lightfoot reckon, with 
 the help of the Jewish calendars, that this course of Abia fell on the
 seventeenth day of the third month, the month Sivan, answering to part 
 of May and part of June, it is worth observing that the portions of the 
 law and the prophets which were read this day in synagogues were very 
 agreeable to that which was doing in the temple; namely, the law of the 
 Nazarites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:1-27">Num. vi.</A>),

 and the conception of Samson, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:1-25">Judg. xiii.</A></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 While Zacharias was burning incense in the temple, <I>the whole 
 multitude of the people were praying without,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Dr. Lightfoot says that there were constantly in the temple, at the 
 hour of prayer, the priests of the course that then served, and, if it 
 were the sabbath day, those of that course also that had been in 
 waiting the week before, and the Levites that served under the priests, 
 and the <I>men of the station,</I> as the Rabbin call them, who were 
 the representatives of the people, in putting their hands upon the head 
 of the sacrifices, and many besides, who, moved by devotion, left their 
 employments, for that time, to be present at the service of God; and 
 those would make up <I>a great multitude,</I> especially on sabbaths 
 and feast-days: now these all addressed themselves to their devotions 
 (in mental prayer, for their voice was not heard), when by the tinkling 
 of a bell they had notice that the priest was gone in to burn incense.
 Now observe here,

 (1.) That the true Israel of God always were a <I>praying</I> people; 
 and prayer is the great and principal piece of service by which we give 
 honour to God, fetch in favours from him, and keep up our communion 
 with him. 

 (2.) That <I>then,</I> when ritual and ceremonial appointments were in 
 full force, as this of <I>burning incense,</I> yet moral and spiritual 
 duties were required to go along with them, and were principally looked 
 at. David knew that when he was at a distance from the altar his prayer 
 might be heard <I>without incense,</I> for it might be directed before 
 God <I>as incense,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:2">Ps. cxli. 2</A>.

 But, when he was <I>compassing the altar,</I> the incense could not be 
 accepted <I>without prayer,</I> any more than the shell without the 
 kernel.

 (3.) That is not enough for us to be where God is worshipped, if our
 hearts do not join in the worship, and go along with the minister, in 
 all the parts of it. If he burn the incense ever so well, in the most 
 pertinent, judicious, lively prayer, if we be not at the same time 
 <I>praying</I> in concurrence with him, what will it avail us? 

 (4.) All the prayers we offer up to God here in his courts are 
 acceptable and successful only in virtue of the incense of Christ's 
 intercession in the temple of God above. To this usage in the 
 temple-service there seems to be an allusion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:1,3,4">Rev. viii. 1, 3, 4</A>),

 where we find that <I>there was silence in heaven,</I> as there was in 
 the temple, <I>for half an hour,</I> while the people were 
 <I>silently</I> lifting up their hearts to God in prayer; and that 
 there was an <I>angel,</I> the angel of the covenant, who offered up 
 <I>much incense with the prayers of all saints before the throne.</I> 
 We cannot expect an interest in Christ's intercession if we do not 
 <I>pray,</I> and pray <I>with our spirits,</I> and continue instant in 
 prayer. Nor can we expect that the best of our prayers should gain 
 acceptance, and bring in an answer of peace, but through the mediation 
 of Christ, who <I>ever lives, making intercession.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How, when he was thus employed, he was <I>honoured</I> with a 
 messenger, a special messenger sent from heaven to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 <I>There appeared unto him an angel of the Lord.</I> Some observe, that 
 we never read of an angel appearing in the temple, with a message from 
 God, but only this one to Zacharias, because <I>there</I> God had other 
 ways of making known his mind, as the Urim and Thummim, and by a still 
 small voice from between the cherubim; but the ark and the oracle were 
 wanting in the second temple, and therefore, when an express was to be 
 sent to a priest in the temple, an angel was to be employed in it, and 
 thereby the gospel was to be introduced, for <I>that,</I> as the 
 <I>law,</I> was given at first very much by the <I>ministry of 
 angels,</I> the appearance of which we often read of in the Gospels and 
 the Acts, though the design both of the law and of the gospel, when 
 brought to perfection, was to settle another way of correspondence, 
 more spiritual, between God and man. This angel stood <I>on the right 
 side of the altar of incense,</I> the north side of it, saith Dr. 
 Lightfoot, on Zacharias's right hand; compare this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:1">Zech. iii. 1</A>,

 where Satan stands at the <I>right hand</I> of Joshua the priest, to
 <I>resist him;</I> but Zacharias had a good angel standing <I>at his 
 right hand,</I> to encourage him. Some think that this angel appeared 
 coming <I>out of the most holy place,</I> which led him to stand at the 
 right side of the altar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What impression this made upon Zacharias 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>When Zacharias saw him,</I> it was a surprise upon him, even to a 
 degree of terror, for he was <I>troubled,</I> and <I>fear fell upon 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Though he was <I>righteous before God,</I> and <I>blameless</I> in his 
 conversation, yet he could not be without some apprehensions at the 
 sight of one whose visage and surrounding lustre bespoke him more than 
 <I>human.</I> Ever since man sinned, his mind has been unable to bear 
 the glory of such revelations and his conscience afraid of evil tidings 
 brought by them; even Daniel himself could not bear it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:8">Dan. x. 8</A>.

 And for this reason God chooses to speak to us by men like ourselves,
 whose <I>terror</I> shall <I>not make us afraid.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The message which the angel had to deliver to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He began his message, as angels generally did, with, <I>Fear not.</I> 
 Perhaps it had never been Zacharias's lot to <I>burn incense</I> 
 before; and, being a very serious conscientious man, we may suppose him 
 full of care to do it <I>well,</I> and perhaps when he saw the angel he 
 was afraid lest he came to rebuke him for some mistake or miscarriage; 
 "No," saith the angel, "<I>fear not;</I> I have no ill tidings to bring 
 thee from heaven. <I>Fear not,</I> but compose thyself, that thou 
 mayest with a sedate and even spirit receive the message I have to 
 deliver thee." Let us see what that is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>prayers</I> he has often made shall now receive an <I>answer 
 of peace: Fear not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard.</I> 

 (1.) If he means his particular prayer <I>for a son</I> to build up his 
 family, it must be the prayers he had formerly made for that mercy, 
 when he was likely to have children; but we may suppose, now that he 
 and his wife were both <I>well stricken in years,</I> as they had done 
 expecting it, so they had done praying for it: like Moses, it 
 <I>sufficeth them,</I> and they <I>speak no more to God of that 
 matter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:26">Deut. iii. 26</A>.

 But God will now, in giving this mercy, look a great way back to the
 prayers that he had made long since for and with his wife, as Isaac for 
 and with his,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:21">Gen. xxv. 21</A>.

 Note, Prayers of faith are <I>filed</I> in heaven, and are not 
 <I>forgotten,</I> though the thing prayed for is not presently 
 <I>given</I> in. Prayers made when we were young and coming into the 
 world may be answered when we are old and going out of the world. But,

 (2.) If he means the prayers he was <I>now making,</I> and offering up
 with his incense, we may suppose that those were according to the duty 
 of his place, for the Israel of God and their welfare, and the 
 performance of the promises made to them concerning the Messiah and the 
 coming of his kingdom: "This prayer of thine is now <I>heard:</I> for
 thy wife shall shortly conceive him that is to be the Messiah's 
 forerunner." Some of the Jewish writers themselves say that the priest, 
 when he burnt incense, prayed for the <I>salvation of the whole 
 world;</I> and now that prayer shall be heard. Or, 

 (3.) In general, "The prayers thou <I>now</I> makest, and all thy 
 prayers, are accepted of God, and <I>come up for a memorial</I> before 
 him" (as the angel said to Cornelius, when he visited him at prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:30,31">Acts x. 30, 31</A>);

 "and this shall be the sign that thou are accepted of God, Elisabeth 
 shall <I>bear thee a son.</I>" Note, it is very comfortable to praying 
 people to know that their <I>prayers</I> are <I>heard;</I> and those 
 mercies are doubly sweet that are given in answer to prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He shall have a son in his old age, by Elisabeth his wife, who had 
 been long barren, that by his birth, which was <I>next</I> to 
 miraculous, people might be prepared to receive and believe a virgin's 
 bringing forth of a son, which was <I>perfectly</I> miraculous. He is 
 directed what name to give his son: <I>Call him John,</I> in Hebrew 
 <I>Johanan,</I> a name we often meet in the Old Testament: it signifies 
 <I>gracious.</I> The priests must <I>beseech God that he will be 
 gracious</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:9">Mal. i. 9</A>),
 
 and must so <I>bless the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:25">Num. vi. 25</A>.

 Zacharias was now praying thus, and the angel tells him that his prayer 
 is heard, and he shall have a son, whom, in token of an answer to his 
 prayer, he shall call <I>Gracious,</I> or, <I>The Lord will be 
 gracious,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:18,19">Isa. xxx. 18, 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This son shall be the joy of his family and of all his relations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He shall be another Isaac, thy laughter; and some think that is partly 
 intended in his name, <I>John.</I> He shall be a <I>welcome child.</I> 
 <I>Thou</I> for thy part <I>shall have joy and gladness.</I> Note, 
 Mercies that have been long <I>waited for,</I> when they <I>come at 
 last,</I> are the more acceptable. "He shall be such a son as thou 
 shalt have reason to rejoice in; many parents, if they could foresee 
 what their children will prove, instead of <I>rejoicing</I> at their 
 birth, would wish they had <I>never been;</I> but I will tell thee what 
 thy son will be, and then thou wilt not need to <I>rejoice with 
 trembling</I> at his birth, as the best must do, but mayest rejoice
 with triumph at it." Nay, and <I>many shall rejoice at his birth;</I>
 all the relations of the family will rejoice in it, and all its
 well-wishers, because it is for the honour and comfort of the family,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>.

 All good people will rejoice that such a religious couple as Zacharias 
 and Elisabeth have a son, because they will give him a good education, 
 such as, it may be hoped, will make him a public blessing to his 
 generation. Yea, and perhaps many shall rejoice by an <I>unaccountable 
 instinct,</I> as a presage of the joyous days the gospel will 
 introduce.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. This son shall be a distinguished <I>favourite of Heaven,</I> and a 
 distinguished <I>blessing to the earth.</I> The honour of having <I>a 
 son</I> is nothing to the honour of having <I>such a son.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He shall be <I>great in the sight of the Lord;</I> those are great 
 indeed that are so in God's sight, not those that are so in the eye of 
 a vain and carnal world. God will <I>set him before his face</I> 
 continually, will employ him in his work and send him on his errands; 
 and that shall make him truly <I>great</I> and honourable. He shall be 
 a <I>prophet,</I> yea <I>more than a prophet,</I> and upon that account 
 as great as any that every were <I>born of women,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:11">Matt. xi. 11</A>.

 He shall live very much <I>retired</I> from the world, out of men's
 sight, and, when he makes a public appearance, it will be very 
 <I>mean;</I> but he shall be <I>much,</I> he shall be <I>great, in the 
 sight of the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shall be a Nazarite, set apart to God from every thing that is 
 <I>polluting;</I> in token of this, according to the law of 
 Nazariteship, he <I>shall drink neither wine nor strong drink,</I>--or,
 rather, neither <I>old</I> wine<I> nor new;</I> for most think that the 
 word here translated <I>strong drink</I> signifies some sort of wine, 
 perhaps those that we call <I>made wines,</I> or any thing that is 
 <I>intoxicating.</I> He shall be, as Samson was by the divine precept 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:7">Judg. xiii. 7</A>),

 and Samuel by his mother's vow 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:11">1 Sam. i. 11</A>),

 a Nazarite for life. It is spoken of as a great instance of God's 
 favour to his people that he <I>raised up</I> of <I>their sons for 
 prophets,</I> and their <I>young men for Nazarites</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11">Amos ii. 11</A>),

 as if those that were designed for prophets were trained up under the 
 discipline of the Nazarites; Samuel and John Baptist were; which 
 intimates that those that would be <I>eminent</I> servants of God, and 
 employed in <I>eminent</I> services, must learn to live a life of 
 self-denial and mortification, must be dead to the pleasures of sense, 
 and keep their minds from every thing that is darkening and disturbing 
 to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He shall be abundantly fitted and qualified for those great and 
 eminent services to which in due time he shall be called: <I>He shall 
 be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb,</I> and as 
 soon as it is possible he shall appear to have been so. Observe, 

 [1.] Those that would be filled with the Holy Ghost must be sober and 
 temperate, and very moderate in the use of wine and strong drink; for 
 <I>that</I> is it that fits him for <I>this.</I> <I>Be not drunk with 
 wine,</I> but <I>be filled with the Spirit,</I> with which that is not 
 consistent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:18">Eph. v. 18</A>.

 [2.] It is possible that infants may be wrought upon by the <I>Holy
 Ghost,</I> even from their <I>mother's womb;</I> for John Baptist even 
 then was <I>filled with the Holy Ghost,</I> who took possession of his 
 heart betimes; and an early specimen was given of it, when he <I>leaped 
 in his mother's womb for joy,</I> at the approach of the Saviour; and 
 afterwards it appeared very early that he was <I>sanctified.</I> God 
 had promised to <I>pour out his Spirit</I> upon the <I>seed</I> of 
 believers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3">Isa. xliv. 3</A>),

 and their first <I>springing up</I> in a dedication of themselves 
 betimes to God is the fruit of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Who then can forbid water, that they should not be baptized who for 
 aught we know (and we can say no more of the adult, witness Simon 
 Magus) have received the Holy Ghost as well as we, and have the 
 <I>seeds of grace</I> sown in their hearts?
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:47">Acts x. 47</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He shall be instrumental for the conversion of many souls to God, 
 and the preparing of them to receive and entertain the gospel of 
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He shall be sent to the <I>children of Israel,</I> to the nation
 of the Jews, to whom the Messiah also was <I>first</I> sent, and not to 
 the Gentiles; to the <I>whole</I> nation, and not the family of <I>the 
 priests only,</I> with which, though he was himself of that family, we 
 do not find he had any particular intimacy or influence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He shall go before <I>the Lord their God,</I> that is, before the 
 Messiah, whom they must expect to be, not <I>their king,</I> in the 
 sense wherein they commonly take it, a <I>temporal prince</I> to their 
 nation, but <I>their Lord</I> and <I>their God,</I> to rule and defend, 
 and serve them in a <I>spiritual</I> way by his influence on their 
 hearts. Thomas knew this, when he said to Christ, <I>My Lord</I> and 
 <I>my God,</I> better than Nathanael did, when he said, <I>Rabbi, thou
 are the king of Israel.</I> John shall <I>go before him,</I> a little 
 before him, to give notice of his approach, and to prepare people to 
 receive him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] He shall go <I>in the spirit and power of Elias.</I> That is, 
 <I>First,</I> He shall be such a man as Elias was, and do such work as 
 Elias did,--shall, like him, preach the necessity of repentance and 
 reformation to a very corrupt and degenerate age,--shall, like him, be 
 bold and zealous in reproving sin and witnessing against it even in the 
 greatest, and be hated and persecuted for it by a Herod and his 
 Herodias, as Elijah was by an Ahab and his Jezebel. He shall be carried 
 on in his work, as Elijah was, by a divine <I>spirit</I> and 
 <I>power,</I> which shall crown his ministry with wonderful success. As 
 Elias went <I>before</I> the <I>writing</I> prophets of the Old 
 Testament, and did as it were <I>usher</I> in that <I>signal</I> period 
 of the Old-Testament dispensation by a little <I>writing</I> of his own 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:12">2 Chron. xxi. 12</A>),

 so John Baptist went before Christ and his apostles, and introduced the 
 gospel dispensation by preaching the substance of the gospel doctrine 
 and duty, <I>Repent, with an eye to the kingdom of heaven.</I> 
 <I>Secondly,</I> He shall be that very person who was prophesied of by 
 Malachi under the name of Elijah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:5">Mal. iv. 5</A>),

 who should be sent <I>before the coming of the day of the Lord.</I> 
 Behold, I <I>send you a prophet, even Elias,</I> not Elias the Tishbite 
 (as the LXX. has corruptly read it, to favour the Jews' traditions), 
 but a prophet <I>in the spirit and power of Elias,</I> as the angel 
 here expounds it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] He shall <I>turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their 
 God,</I> shall incline their hearts to receive the Messiah, and bid him 
 welcome, by awakening them to a sense of sin and a desire of 
 righteousness. Whatever has a tendency to <I>turn us from iniquity,</I> 
 as John's preaching and baptism had, will turn us to Christ as <I>our 
 Lord and our God;</I> for those who through grace are wrought upon to 
 shake off the yoke of sin, that is, the dominion of the world and the 
 flesh, will soon be persuaded to take upon them the yoke of the <I>Lord 
 Jesus.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] Hereby he shall <I>turn the hearts of the fathers to the 
 children,</I> that is, of the Jews to the Gentiles; shall help to 
 conquer the rooted prejudices which the Jews have against the Gentiles, 
 which was done by the gospel, as far as it prevailed, and was begun to 
 be done by John Baptist, who came <I>for a witness, that all through 
 him might believe,</I> who baptized and taught Roman soldiers as well 
 as Jewish Pharisees, and who cured the pride and confidence of those 
 Jews who gloried in their having Abraham to their father, and told them 
 that God would <I>out of stones raise up children unto Abraham</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:9">Matt. iii. 9</A>),

 which would tend to <I>cure</I> their enmity to the Gentiles. Dr.
 Lightfoot observes, It is the constant usage of the prophets to speak 
 of the church of the Gentiles as children to the Jewish church, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:5,6,13,60:4,9,62:5,66:12">Isa. liv. 5, 6, 13;
 lx. 4, 9; lxii. 5; lxvi. 12</A>.

 When the Jews that embraced the faith of Christ were brought to join in
 communion with the Gentiles that did so too, then the heart of the 
 fathers was turned to the children. And he shall <I>turn the 
 disobedient to the wisdom of the just,</I> that is, he shall introduce 
 the gospel, by which the Gentiles, who are now <I>disobedient,</I> 
 shall be turned, no so much to their fathers the Jews, but to the faith 
 of Christ, here called the <I>wisdom of the just,</I> in communion with 
 the believing Jews; or thus, He shall <I>turn the hearts of the fathers 
 with the children,</I> that is, the hearts of old and young, shall be 
 instrumental to bring some of every age to be <I>religious,</I> to work 
 a great reformation in the Jewish nation, to bring them <I>off from</I> 
 a ritual traditional religion which that had rested in, and to bring 
 them up to <I>substantial serious</I> godliness: and the effect of this 
 will be, that enmities will be slain and discord made to cease; and 
 they are at variance, being united in his baptism, will be better 
 reconciled one to another. This agrees with the account Josephus gives 
 of John Baptist, <I>Antiq.</I> 18. 117-118. "That he was a good man, and
 taught the Jews the exercise of virtue, in piety towards God, and 
 righteous towards one another, and that they should convene and knit 
 together in baptism." And he saith, "The people flocked after him, and 
 were exceedingly delighted in his doctrine." Thus he turned the hearts 
 of fathers and children to God and to one another, by <I>turning the 
 disobedient to the wisdom of the just.</I> Observe, <I>First,</I> True 
 religion is <I>the wisdom of just men,</I> in distinction from the 
 <I>wisdom of the world.</I> It is both our wisdom and our duty to be 
 religious; there is both equity and prudence in it. <I>Secondly,</I> It 
 is not possible but that those who have been unbelieving and 
 <I>disobedient</I> may be turned to the <I>wisdom of the just;</I> 
 divine grace can conquer the greatest ignorance and prejudice. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> The great design of the gospel is to bring people 
 <I>home</I> to God, and to bring them nearer to <I>one another;</I> and 
 on this errand John Baptist is sent. In the mention that is
 <I>twice</I> made of his <I>turning</I> people, there seems to be an 
 allusion to the name of the Tishbite, which is given to Elijah, which, 
 some think, does not denote the country or city he was of, but has an 
 appellative signification, and therefore the render it Elijah the 
 <I>converter,</I> one that was much employed, and very successful, in 
 <I>conversion-work.</I> The Elias of the New Testament is therefore 
 said to <I>turn</I> or <I>convert</I> many to the Lord their God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [6.] Hereby he shall <I>make ready a people prepared for the Lord,</I> 
 shall dispose the minds of people to receive the doctrine of Christ, 
 that thereby they may be <I>prepared</I> for the comforts of his 
 coming. Note, <I>First,</I> All that are to be <I>devoted</I> to the 
 Lord, and <I>made happy</I> in him, must first be <I>prepared</I> and 
 <I>made ready</I> for him. We must be prepared by grace in this world 
 for the glory in the other, by the terrors of the law for the comforts 
 of the gospel, by the spirit of bondage for the Spirit of adoption. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Nothing has a more direct tendency to prepare people 
 for Christ than the doctrine of repentance received and submitted to. 
 When sin is thereby made grievous, Christ will become very 
 precious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Zacharias's unbelief of the angel's prediction, and the rebuke he 
 was laid under for that unbelief. He heard all that the angel had to 
 say, and should have bowed his head, and worshipped the Lord, saying, 
 <I>Be it unto thy servant according to the word</I> which thou hast 
 spoken; but it was not so. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What his unbelief spoke, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He said to the angel, <I>Whereby shall I know this?</I> This was not a 
 humble petition for the confirming of his faith, but a peevish 
 objection against what was said to him as altogether incredible; as if 
 he should say, "I can never be made to believe this." He could not but 
 perceive that it was <I>an angel</I> that spoke to him; the message 
 delivered, having reference to the Old-Testament prophecies, carried 
 much of its own evidence along with it. There are many instances in the 
 Old Testament of those that had children when they were old, yet he 
 cannot believe that he shall have this child of promise: "<I>For I am 
 an old man,</I> and my wife hath not only been all her days barren, but 
 is now well <I>stricken in years,</I> and not likely ever to have 
 children." Therefore he must have a <I>sign</I> given him, or he will 
 not believe. Though the appearance of an angel, which had long been 
 disused in the church, was sign enough,--though he had this notice 
 given him in the temple, the place of God's oracles, where he had 
 reason to think no evil angel would be permitted to come,--though it 
 was given him when he was praying, and burning incense,--and though a 
 firm belief of that great principle of religion that God has an 
 almighty power, and with him <I>nothing is impossible,</I> which we 
 ought not only to <I>know,</I> but to teach others, was enough to 
 silence all objections,--yet, considering his own body and his wife's 
 too much, unlike a son of Abraham, he <I>staggered at the promise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:19,20">Rom. iv. 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How his unbelief was <I>silenced,</I> and he <I>silenced</I> for 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The angel <I>stops his mouth,</I> by <I>asserting</I> his 
 authority. Doth he ask, <I>Whereby shall I know this?</I> Let him know 
 it by this, <I>I am Gabriel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He puts his name to his prophecy, doth as it were sign it with his own 
 hand, <I>teste meipso--take my word for it.</I> Angels have sometimes 
 refused to tell their names, as to Manoah and his wife; but his angel 
 readily saith, <I>I am Gabriel,</I> which signifies <I>the power of 
 God,</I> or the <I>mighty one of God,</I> intimating that the God who 
 bade him say this was able to make it good. He also makes himself known 
 by this name to put him in mind of the notices of the Messiah's coming 
 sent to Daniel by the <I>man Gabriel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:16,9:21">Dan. viii. 16; ix. 21</A>.

 "<I>I am the same</I> that was sent then, and am sent now in pursuance
 of the same intention." He is Gabriel, who <I>stands in the presence of 
 God,</I> an immediate attendant upon the throne of God. The prime 
 ministers of state in the Persian court are described by this, that 
 they <I>saw the king's face,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:14">Esth. i. 14</A>.

 "Though I am now talking with thee here, yet <I>I stand in the presence
 of God.</I> I know his eye is upon me, and I dare not say any more than 
 I have warrant to say. But I declare <I>I am sent to speak to
 thee,</I> sent on purpose to <I>show thee these glad tidings,</I> 
 which, being so well worthy of all acceptation, thou oughtest to have 
 received cheerfully."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The angel <I>stops his mouth</I> indeed, by <I>exerting his 
 power:</I> "That thou mayest object no more, <I>behold thou shalt be 
 dumb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 If thou wilt have a sign for the support of thy faith, it shall be such 
 a one as shall be also the punishment of thine unbelief; thou <I>shalt 
 not be able to speak till the day that these things shall be 
 performed,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Thou shalt be both <I>dumb</I> and <I>deaf;</I> the same word signifies 
 both, and it is plain that he lost his hearing as well as his speech, 
 for his friends <I>made signs</I> to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>),

 as well as he to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Now, in striking him dumb,

 [1.] God dealt <I>justly</I> with him, because he had objected against 
 God's word. Hence we may take occasion to admire the patience of God 
 and his forbearance toward us, that we, who have often spoken to his 
 dishonour, have not been struck dumb, as Zacharias was, and as we had 
 been if God had dealt with us according to our sins.

 [2.] God dealt <I>kindly</I> with him, and very tenderly and 
 graciously. For, <I>First,</I> Thus he prevented his speaking any more 
 such distrustful unbelieving words. If he has <I>thought evil,</I> and 
 will not himself <I>lay his hands upon his mouth,</I> nor keep it as 
 with a bridle, God will. It is better not to speak at all than to 
 <I>speak wickedly.</I> <I>Secondly,</I> Thus he <I>confirmed</I> his 
 faith; and, by his being disabled to <I>speak,</I> he is enabled to 
 <I>think</I> the better. If by the rebukes we are under for our sin we 
 be brought to give more credit to the word of God, we have no reason to 
 complain of them. <I>Thirdly,</I> Thus he was kept from divulging the
 vision, and boasting of it, which otherwise he would have been apt to 
 do, whereas it was designed for the present to be lodged as a secret 
 with him. <I>Fourthly,</I> It was a great mercy that God's words
 should be fulfilled in their season, notwithstanding his sinful 
 distrust. The <I>unbelief of man</I> shall not <I>make the promises of 
 God of no effect,</I> they shall be <I>fulfilled in their season,</I> 
 and he shall not be for ever <I>dumb,</I> but only <I>till the day that 
 these things shall be performed,</I> and then thy <I>lips</I> shall be 
 <I>opened,</I> that thy <I>mouth</I> may <I>show forth God's 
 praise.</I> Thus, though God <I>chastens</I> the <I>iniquity</I> of his 
 people <I>with the rod,</I> yet his <I>loving kindness</I> he <I>will 
 not take away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The return of Zacharias to the people, and at length to his family, 
 and the conception of this child of promise, the son of his old 
 age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The people staid, expecting Zacharias to come out of the temple, 
 because he was to pronounce the blessing upon them in the name of the 
 Lord; and, though he staid beyond the usual time, yet they did not, as 
 is too common in Christian congregations, hurry away without the 
 blessing, but <I>waited</I> for him, marvelling that he <I>tarried so 
 long in the temple,</I> and afraid let something was amiss, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When he came out, he was <I>speechless,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He was now to have dismissed the congregation with a blessing, but was 
 dumb and not able to do it, that the people may be minded to expect the 
 Messiah, who can <I>command</I> the blessing, who <I>blesseth 
 indeed,</I> and in whom all <I>the nations of the earth are 
 blessed.</I> Aaron's priesthood is now shortly to be <I>silenced</I> 
 and <I>set aside,</I> to make way for the <I>bringing in</I> of a 
 <I>better hope.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He made a shift to give them to understand that he had <I>seen a 
 vision,</I> by some awful signs he made, for he <I>beckoned to 
 them,</I> and <I>remained speechless,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 This represents to us the weakness and deficiency of the Levitical 
 priesthood, in comparison with Christ's priesthood and the dispensation 
 of the gospel. The Old Testament speaks by signs, gives us some 
 intimations of divine and heavenly things, but <I>imperfect</I> and 
 uncertain; it <I>beckons to us,</I> but <I>remains speechless.</I> It 
 is the gospel that speaks to us articulately, and gives us a clear view 
 of that which the Old Testament was seen <I>through a glass 
 darkly.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He staid out the <I>days of his ministration;</I> for, his lot being 
 to <I>burn incense,</I> he could do that, though he was <I>dumb</I> and 
 <I>deaf.</I> When we cannot perform the service of God so well as we 
 would, yet, if we perform it as well as we can, God will accept of us 
 in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>26  And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
 unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
 &nbsp; 27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
 house of David; and the virgin's name <I>was</I> Mary.
 &nbsp; 28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, <I>thou that
 art</I> highly favoured, the Lord <I>is</I> with thee: blessed <I>art</I> thou
 among women.
 &nbsp; 29 And when she saw <I>him,</I> she was troubled at his saying, and
 cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
 &nbsp; 30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
 found favour with God.
 &nbsp; 31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring
 forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
 &nbsp; 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the
 Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his
 father David:
 &nbsp; 33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of
 his kingdom there shall be no end.
 &nbsp; 34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I
 know not a man?
 &nbsp; 35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost
 shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
 overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be
 born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a
 son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was
 called barren.
 &nbsp; 37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.
 &nbsp; 38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto
 me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here notice given us of all that it was fit we should know 
 concerning the incarnation and conception of our blessed Saviour, six 
 months after the conception of John. The same angel, Gabriel, that was 
 employed in making known to Zacharias God's purpose concerning <I>his 
 son,</I> is employed in this also; for in this, the same glorious work 
 of redemption, which was <I>begun</I> in that, is <I>carried on.</I> As 
 bad angels are none of the redeemed, so good angels are none of the 
 redeemers; yet they are employed by the Redeemer as his messengers, and 
 they go cheerfully on his errands, because they are his Father's humble 
 servants, and his children's hearty friends and well-wishers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here an account given of the mother of our Lord, of whom he 
 was to be born, whom, though we are not to pray to, yet we ought to 
 praise God for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Her name was <I>Mary,</I> the same name with <I>Miriam,</I> the 
 sister of Moses and Aaron; the name signifies <I>exalted,</I> and a 
 great elevation it was to her indeed to be thus <I>favoured</I> above 
 all the daughters of the house of David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She was a daughter of the royal family, lineally descended from 
 David, and she herself and all her friends knew it, for she went under 
 the title and character of the <I>house of David,</I> though she was 
 poor and low in the world; and she was enabled by God's providence, and 
 the care of the Jews, to preserve their genealogies, to <I>make it 
 out,</I> and as long as the promise of the Messiah was to be fulfilled 
 it was <I>worth keeping;</I> but for those now, who are brought low in 
 the world, to have descended from persons of honour, is not worth 
 mentioning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She was <I>a virgin,</I> a pure unspotted one, but <I>espoused</I> 
 to one of the same royal stock, like her, however, of low estate; so 
 that upon both accounts there was (as it was fit there should be) an 
 equality between them; his name was Joseph; he also was <I>of the house 
 of David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:20">Matt. i. 20</A>.

 Christ's mother was a <I>virgin,</I> because he was not to be born by
 ordinary generation, but miraculously; it was necessary that he should 
 be so, that, though he must partake of the nature of man, yet not of 
 the corruption of that nature: but he was born of a <I>virgin 
 espoused,</I> made up to be married, and contracted, to put honour upon 
 the married state, that that might not be brought into contempt (which 
 was an ordinance in innocency) by the Redeemer's being born of a 
 virgin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. She lived in Nazareth, a <I>city of Galilee,</I> a remote corner of 
 the country, and in no reputation for religion or learning, but which 
 bordered upon the heathen, and therefore was called <I>Galilee of the 
 Gentiles.</I> Christ's having his relations resident there intimates 
 favour in reserve for the Gentile world. And Dr. Lightfoot observes 
 that Jonah was by birth a Galilean, and Elijah and Elisha very much 
 conversant in Galilee, who were all famous <I>prophets of the 
 Gentiles.</I> The angel was sent to her from Nazareth. Note, No 
 distance or disadvantage of place shall be a prejudice to those for 
 whom God has favours in store. The angel Gabriel carries his message as 
 cheerfully to Mary and Nazareth in Galilee as to Zacharias in the 
 temple at Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>address</I> of the angel to her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 We are not told what she was doing, or how employed, when the angel 
 came <I>unto her;</I> but he surprised her with this salutation, 
 <I>Hail, thou art highly favoured.</I> This was intended to raise in 
 her, 

 1. A value for <I>herself;</I> and, though it is very rare that any
 need to have any sparks struck into their breast with such design, yet 
 in some, who like Mary pore only on their <I>low estate,</I> there is 
 occasion for it. 

 2. An expectation of great news, not from abroad, but from above.
 Heaven designs, no doubt, uncommon favours for one whom an angel makes 
 court to with such respect, <I>Hail thou,</I> 
 <B><I>chaire</I></B>--<I>rejoice thou;</I> it was the usual form of 
 salutation; it expresses an esteem of her, and good-will to her and her 
 prosperity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) She is dignified: "Thou art <I>highly favoured.</I> God, in his 
 choice of thee to be the mother of the Messiah, has put an honour upon 
 thee peculiar to thyself, above that of Eve, who was the mother of 
 <I>all living.</I>" The vulgar Latin translates this <I>grati&aacute; 
 plena--full of grace,</I> and thence gathers that she had more of the
 inherent graces of the Spirit than ever any had; whereas it is certain 
 that this bespeaks no other than the singular favour done her in 
 preferring her to conceive and bear our blessed Lord, an honour which, 
 since he was to be the <I>seed of the woman,</I> some woman must have, 
 not for <I>personal merit,</I> but purely for the sake of <I>free 
 grace,</I> and she is pitched upon. <I>Even so, Father, because it 
 seemed good unto thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) She has the presence of God with her: "<I>The Lord is with 
 thee,</I> though poor and mean, and perhaps now forecasting how to get 
 a livelihood and maintain a family in the married state." The angel 
 with this word raised the faith of Gideon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:12">Judg. vi. 12</A>):

 <I>The Lord is with thee.</I> Nothing is to be despaired of, not the 
 performance of any service, not the obtaining of any favour, though 
 ever so great, if we have <I>God with us.</I> This word might put her 
 in mind of the Immanuel, <I>God with us,</I> which a virgin shall 
 <I>conceive</I> and <I>bear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:14">Isa. vii. 14</A>),
 
 and why not she?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) She has the blessing of God upon her: "<I>Blessed art thou among 
 women;</I> not only thou shalt be accounted so by men, but thou shalt 
 be so. Thou that art so <I>highly favoured</I> in this instance mayest 
 expect in other things to be <I>blessed.</I>" She explains this herself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 <I>All generations shall call me blessed.</I> Compare it with that 
 which Deborah saith of Jael, another that was the glory of her sex 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:24">Judg. v. 24</A>),

 <I>Blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The consternation she was in, upon this address 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>).

 <I>When she saw him,</I> and the glories with which he was surrounded, 
 she was <I>troubled</I> at the sight of him, and much more <I>at his 
 saying.</I> Had she been a proud ambitious young woman, that aimed 
 high, and flattered herself with the expectation of great things in the 
 world, she would have been <I>pleased</I> at his saying, would have 
 been puffed up with it, and (as we have reason to think she was a young 
 woman of very good sense) would have had an answer ready, signifying so 
 much: but, instead of that, she is <I>confounded</I> at it, as not 
 conscious to herself of any thing that either <I>merited</I> or 
 <I>promised</I> such great things; and she <I>cast in her mind what 
 manner of salutation this should be.</I> Was it from heaven or of men?
 Was it to amuse her? was it to ensnare her? was it to banter her? or 
 was there something substantial and weighty in it? But, of all the 
 thoughts she had as to <I>what manner of salutation it should be,</I> I 
 believe she had not the least idea of its being ever intended or used 
 for a prayer, as it is, and has been, for many ages, by the corrupt, 
 degenerate, and anti-christian ages of the church, and to be ten times 
 repeated for the Lord's prayer once; so it is in the church of Rome.
 But her thoughtfulness upon this occasion gives a very useful 
 intimation to young people of her sex, when addresses are made to them, 
 to consider and <I>cast in their minds</I> what manner of 
 <I>salutations</I> they are, whence they come, and what their tendency 
 is, that they may receive them accordingly, and may always <I>stand on 
 their guard.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The message itself which the angel had to deliver to her. Some time 
 the angel gives her to <I>pause;</I> but, observing that this did but 
 increase her perplexity, he went on with his errand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 To what he had said she made no reply; he therefore confirms it: 
 "<I>Fear not, Mary,</I> I have no other design than to assure thee that 
 <I>thou hast found favour with God</I> more than thou thinkest of, as 
 there are many who think they are more favoured with God than they 
 really are." Note, Those that have <I>found favour with God</I> should 
 not give way to disquieting distrustful fears. Doth God favour thee? 
 Fear not, though the world frown upon thee. Is he for thee? No matter 
 who is against thee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Though she is a <I>virgin,</I> she shall have the honour of being a 
 <I>mother:</I> "<I>Thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a 
 son,</I> and thou shalt have the naming of him; thou shalt <I>call his 
 name Jesus,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 It was the sentence upon Eve, that, though she should have the honour 
 to be the <I>mother of all living,</I> yet this mortification shall be 
 an allay to that honour, that <I>her desire shall be to her 
 husband,</I> and he <I>shall rule over her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:16">Gen. iii. 16</A>.

 But Mary has the honour without the allay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Though she lives in <I>poverty</I> and <I>obscurity,</I> yet she 
 shall have the honour to be the mother of the Messiah; her son shall be 
 named <I>Jesus--a Saviour,</I> such a one as the world <I>needs,</I>
 rather than such one as the Jews <I>expect.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He will be very <I>nearly allied</I> to the <I>upper world.</I> He 
 <I>shall be great,</I> truly great, incontestably great; for he shall 
 be called <I>the Son of the Highest,</I> the Son of God who is <I>the 
 Highest;</I> of the same nature, as the son is of the same nature with 
 the father; and very dear to him, as the son is to the father. He shall 
 be <I>called,</I> and not <I>miscalled,</I> the <I>Son of the 
 Highest;</I> for he is himself <I>God over all, blessed for 
 evermore,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:5">Rom. ix. 5</A>.

 Note, Those who are the children of God, though but by adoption and
 regeneration, are <I>truly great,</I> and therefore are concerned to be 
 <I>very good,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:1,2">1 John iii. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He will be very <I>highly preferred</I> in the <I>lower world;</I> 
 for, though born under the most disadvantageous circumstances possible, 
 and appearing in the form of a servant, yet <I>the Lord God shall give 
 unto him the throne of his father David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 He puts her in mind that she was <I>of the house of David;</I> and that 
 therefore, since neither the <I>Salique law,</I> nor the right of 
 primogeniture, took place in the entail of his throne, it was not 
 impossible but that she might bring forth an heir to it, and therefore 
 might the more easily <I>believe</I> it when she was told by an angel 
 from heaven that she <I>should</I> do so, that after the sceptre had 
 been long <I>departed</I> from that ancient and honourable family it 
 should now at length return to it again, to remain in it, not by 
 succession, but in the same hand to eternity. His people will not 
 <I>give him that throne,</I> will not acknowledge his right to <I>rule 
 them;</I> but the <I>Lord God</I> shall give him a right to <I>rule 
 them,</I> and set him as <I>his king</I> upon the <I>holy hill of 
 Zion.</I> He assures her,

 [1.] That his kingdom shall be <I>spiritual:</I> he shall <I>reign over 
 the house of Jacob,</I> not <I>Israel according to the flesh,</I> for 
 they neither came into his interests nor did they continue long a 
 people; it must therefore be a <I>spiritual</I> kingdom, the house of 
 Israel <I>according to the promise,</I> that he must <I>rule over.</I> 
 
 [2.] That it shall be eternal: he shall reign <I>for ever,</I> and 
 <I>of his kingdom there shall be no end,</I> as there had been long 
 since of the temporal reign of David's house, and would shortly be of 
 the state of Israel. Other crowns endure not <I>to every 
 generation,</I> but Christ's doth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:24">Prov. xxvii. 24</A>.

 The gospel is the <I>last</I> dispensation, we are to look for no 
 other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The further information given her, upon her enquiry concerning the 
 birth of this prince.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is a just enquiry which she makes: "<I>How shall this be?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 How can I now presently conceive a child" (for so the angel meant)
 "when I <I>know not a man;</I> must it therefore be otherwise than by 
 ordinary generation? If so, let me now <I>how?</I>" She knew that the 
 Messiah must be born of <I>a virgin;</I> and, if she must be his 
 mother, she desires to know how. This was not the language of her 
 distrust, or any doubt of what the angel said, but of a desire to be 
 further instructed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is a satisfactory answer that is given to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 (1.) She shall conceive by <I>the power of the Holy Ghost,</I> whose 
 proper work and office is to <I>sanctify,</I> and therefore to sanctify 
 the virgin for this purpose. The Holy Ghost is called the <I>power of 
 the Highest.</I> Doth she ask how this shall be? This is enough to help 
 her over all the difficulty there appears in it; a divine power will 
 undertake it, not the power of an angel employed in it, as in other 
 works of wonder, but the power of <I>the Holy Ghost</I> himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) She must <I>ask no questions</I> concerning the way and manner how 
 it shall be wrought; for the Holy Ghost, as the <I>power of the 
 Highest,</I> shall <I>overshadow</I> her, as the <I>cloud</I> covered 
 the tabernacle when the glory of God took possession of it, to conceal 
 it from those that would too curiously observe the motions of it, and 
 pry into the mystery of it. The formation of every babe in the womb, 
 and the entrance of the spirit of life into it, is a mystery in nature; 
 none knows <I>the way of the spirit, nor how the bones are formed in 
 the womb of her that is with child,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:5">Eccl. xi. 5</A>.

 We were <I>made in secret,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:15,16">Ps. cxxxix. 15, 16</A>.

 Much more was the formation of the child Jesus a <I>mystery;</I>
 without controversy, <I>great was the mystery of godliness, God
 manifest in the flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>.

 It is a <I>new thing created in the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:22">Jer. xxxi. 22</A>),

 concerning which we must not covet to be <I>wise above what is
 written.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The child she shall conceive is a <I>holy thing,</I> and therefore 
 must not be conceived by <I>ordinary generation,</I> because he must 
 not share in the common corruption and pollution of the human nature. 
 He is spoken of emphatically, <I>That Holy Thing,</I> such as never 
 was; and he shall be called <I>the Son of God,</I> as the Son of the 
 Father by eternal generation, as an indication of which he shall now be 
 formed by the Holy Ghost in the present conception. His human nature 
 must be so produced, as it was fit that should be which was to be taken 
 into union with the divine nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It was a further encouragement to her faith to be told that <I>her 
 cousin Elisabeth,</I> though stricken in years, was <I>with child,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Here is an age of wonders beginning, and therefore be not surprised: 
 here is one among thy own relations truly great, though not altogether 
 so great as this; it is usual with God to advance in working wonders.
 <I>Greater works than these shall ye do.</I> Though Elisabeth was, on 
 the father's side, of the <I>daughters of Aaron</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 yet on the mother's side she might be of the house of David, for those 
 two families often intermarried, as an earnest of the uniting of the 
 royalty and the priesthood of the Messiah. <I>This is the sixth month 
 with her that was called barren.</I> This intimates, as Dr. Lightfoot 
 thinks, that all the instances in the Old Testament of those having 
 children that had been long barren, which was above nature, were 
 designed to prepare the world for the belief of a virgin's bearing a 
 son, which was against nature. And therefore, even in the birth of 
 Isaac, Abraham saw Christ's day, foresaw such a miracle in the birth of 
 Christ. The angel assures Mary of this, to encourage her faith, and 
 concludes with that great truth, of undoubted certainty and universal 
 use, <I>For with God nothing shall be impossible</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 and, if nothing, then not this. Abraham therefore staggered not at the 
 belief of the divine promise, because he was strong in his belief of 
 the divine power, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:20,21">Rom. iv. 20, 21</A>.

 No <I>word</I> of God must be <I>incredible to us,</I> as long as no
 <I>work</I> of God is <I>impossible to him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Her acquiescence in the will of God concerning her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 She owns herself, 

 1. A believing subject to the divine authority: "<I>Behold, the 
 handmaid of the Lord.</I> Lord, I am at thy service, at thy disposal, 
 to do what thou commandest me." She objects not the danger of spoiling 
 her marriage, and blemishing her reputation, but leaves the issue with 
 God, and submits entirely to his will. 

 2. A believing expectant of the divine favour. She is not only content
 that it should be so, but humbly desires that it may be so: <I>Be it 
 unto me according to thy word.</I> Such a favour as this it was not for 
 her to slight, or be indifferent to; and for what God has 
 <I>promised</I> he will be <I>sought unto;</I> by prayer we must put 
 our <I>amen,</I> or <I>so be it,</I> to the promise. <I>Remember,</I> 
 and perform <I>thy word unto thy servant, upon which thou has caused me 
 to hope.</I> We must, as Mary here, <I>guide</I> our desires by the 
 word of God, and <I>ground</I> our hopes <I>upon</I> it. Be it unto me 
 <I>according to thy word;</I> just so, and no otherwise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hereupon, <I>the angel departed from her;</I> having completed the 
 errand he was sent upon, he returned, to give an account of it, and 
 receive new instructions. Converse with angels was always a transient 
 thing, and soon over; it will be constant and permanent in the future 
 state. It is generally supposed that just at this instant the virgin 
 <I>conceived,</I> by the <I>overshadowing power</I> of the Holy Ghost: 
 but, the scripture being decently silent concerning it, it doth not 
 become us to be <I>inquisitive,</I> much less <I>positive.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>39  And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country
 with haste, into a city of Juda;
 &nbsp; 40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted
 Elisabeth.
 &nbsp; 41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the
 salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth
 was filled with the Holy Ghost:
 &nbsp; 42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed <I>art</I>
 thou among women, and blessed <I>is</I> the fruit of thy womb.
 &nbsp; 43 And whence <I>is</I> this to me, that the mother of my Lord
 should come to me?
 &nbsp; 44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in
 mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
 &nbsp; 45 And blessed <I>is</I> she that believed: for there shall be a
 performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
 &nbsp; 46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,
 &nbsp; 47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
 &nbsp; 48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
 behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
 &nbsp; 49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy
 <I>is</I> his name.
 &nbsp; 50 And his mercy <I>is</I> on them that fear him from generation to
 generation.
 &nbsp; 51 He hath showed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the
 proud in the imagination of their hearts.
 &nbsp; 52 He hath put down the mighty from <I>their</I> seats, and exalted
 them of low degree.
 &nbsp; 53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he
 hath sent empty away.
 &nbsp; 54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of <I>his</I>
 mercy;
 &nbsp; 55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for
 ever.
 &nbsp; 56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to
 her own house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an interview between the two happy mothers, Elisabeth and 
 Mary: the angel, by intimating to Mary the favour bestowed on her 
 cousin Elisabeth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 gave occasion for it; and sometimes it may prove a better piece of 
 service that we think to bring good people together, to compare notes. 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The visit which Mary made to Elisabeth. Mary was the <I>younger,</I> 
 and younger with child; and therefore, if they must come together, it 
 was fittest that Mary should take the journey, not insisting on the 
 preference which the greater dignity of her conception gave her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.
 
 She <I>arose,</I> and left her affairs, to attend this greater matter:
 <I>in those days, at that time</I> (as it is commonly explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:15,50:4">Jer. xxxiii. 15; l. 4</A>),

 in a day or two after the angel had visited her, taking some time 
 first, as it is supposed, for her devotion, or rather hastening away to 
 her cousin's, where she would have more leisure, and better help, in 
 the family of a priest. She went, <B><I>meta spoudes</I></B>--<I>with 
 care, diligence,</I> and <I>expedition;</I> not as young people 
 commonly go abroad and visit their friends, to <I>divert</I> herself, 
 but to <I>inform</I> herself: she went <I>to a city of Judah in the 
 hill-country;</I> it is not named, but by comparing the description of 
 it here with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:10,11">Josh. xxi. 10, 11</A>,

 it appears to be <I>Hebron,</I> for that is there said to be <I>in the
 hill-country of Judah,</I> and to belong to the priests, the sons of 
 Aaron; thither Mary hastened, though it was a long journey, some scores 
 of miles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Dr. Lightfoot offers a conjecture that she was to <I>conceive</I> 
 our Saviour there at Hebron, and perhaps had so much intimated to her 
 by the angel, or some other way; and therefore she made such haste 
 thither. He thinks it probable that Shiloh, of the tribe of Judah, and 
 the seed of David, should be <I>conceived</I> in a city of Judah and of 
 David, as he was to be born in Bethlehem, another city which belonged 
 to them both. In Hebron the promise was given to Isaac, circumcision 
 was instituted. Here (saith he) Abraham had his first land, and David
 his first crown: here lay interred the three couples, Abraham and 
 Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah, and, as antiquity has held, 
 Adam and Eve. He therefore thinks that it suits singularly with the 
 harmony and consent which God uses in his works that the promise should 
 begin to take place by the conception of the Messias, even among those 
 patriarchs to whom it was given. I see no improbability in the 
 conjecture, but add this for the support of it, that Elisabeth said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),

 <I>There shall be a performance;</I> as if it were not performed yet, 
 but was to be performed there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is generally supposed that she went thither for the confirming of 
 her faith by the sign which the angel had given her, her cousin's being 
 with child, and to rejoice with her sister-favourite. And, besides, she 
 went thither, perhaps, that she might be more retired from company, or 
 else might have more agreeable company than she could have in Nazareth. 
 We may suppose that she did not acquaint any of her neighbours at 
 Nazareth with the message she had received from heaven, yet longed to 
 <I>talk over</I> a thing she had a thousand time <I>thought over,</I> 
 and knew no person in the world with whom she could <I>freely</I> 
 converse concerning it but her cousin Elisabeth, and therefore she 
 hastened to her. Note, it is very beneficial and comfortable for those 
 that have a good work of grace begun in their souls, and Christ in the 
 <I>forming</I> there, to consult those who are in the same case, that 
 they may communicate experiences one to another; and they will find 
 that, as in water face answers to face, so doth the heart of man to 
 man, of Christian to Christian.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The meeting between Mary and Elisabeth. Mary entered into the house
 of Zacharias; but he, being <I>dumb</I> and <I>deaf,</I> kept his 
 chamber, it is probable, and saw no company; and therefore she 
 <I>saluted Elisabeth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 told her she was come to make her a visit, to know her state, and 
 <I>rejoice with her</I> in her joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, at their first coming together, for the confirmation of the faith 
 of both of them, there was something very extraordinary. Mary knew that 
 Elisabeth was with child, but it does not appear that Elisabeth had 
 been told any thing of her cousin Mary's being designed for the mother 
 of the Messiah; and therefore what knowledge she appears to have had of 
 it must have come by a <I>revelation,</I> which would be a great 
 encouragement to Mary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The babe <I>leaped in her womb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 It is very probable that she had been several weeks <I>quick</I> (for 
 she was six months gone), and that she had often felt the child stir; 
 but this was a more than ordinary motion of the child, which alarmed 
 her to expect something very extraordinary, <B><I>eskirtese</I></B>. It 
 is the same word that is used by the LXX.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:22">Gen. xxv. 22</A>)

 for the <I>struggling</I> of Jacob and Esau in Rebecca's womb, and the 
 mountains <I>skipping,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:4">Ps. cxiv. 4</A>.
 
 The <I>babe leaped</I> as it were to give a signal to his mother that 
 <I>he</I> was now at had whose forerunner he was to be, about six 
 months in ministry, as he was in being; or, it was the effect of some 
 strong impression made upon the mother. Now began to be fulfilled what 
 the angel said to his father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 that he should be <I>filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's 
 womb;</I> and perhaps he himself had some reference to this, when he 
 said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:29">John iii. 29</A>),

 <I>The friend of the Bridegroom rejoiceth greatly, because of the 
 Bridegroom's voice,</I> heard, though not by him, yet by his 
 mother.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Elisabeth was herself <I>filled with the Holy Ghost,</I> or a Spirit 
 of prophecy, by which, as well as by the particular suggestions of the 
 Holy Ghost she was filled with, she was given to understand that the 
 Messiah was at hand, in whom prophecy should revive, and by whom the 
 Holy Ghost should be more plentifully poured out than ever, according 
 to the expectations of those who <I>waited for the consolation of 
 Israel.</I> The uncommon motion of the babe in her womb was a token of 
 extraordinary emotion of her spirit under a divine impulse. Note, Those 
 whom Christ graciously visits may know it by their being <I>filled with 
 the Holy Ghost;</I> for, <I>if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, 
 he is none of his.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The welcome which Elisabeth, by the Spirit of prophecy, gave to 
 Mary, the mother of our Lord; not as to a common friend making a common 
 visit, but as to one of whom the Messiah was to be born.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She congratulates her on her honour, and, though perhaps she knew 
 not of it till <I>just now,</I> she acknowledges it with the greatest 
 assurance and satisfaction. She <I>spoke with a loud voice,</I> which 
 does not at all intimate (as some think) that there was a floor or a 
 wall between them, but that she was in a transport or exultation of 
 joy, and said what she cared not who knew. She said, <I>Blessed art 
 thou among women,</I> the same word that the angels had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);
 
 for thus this will of God, concerning honouring the Son, should be done 
 <I>on earth</I> as it is <I>done in heaven.</I> But Elisabeth adds a 
 reason, <I>Therefore blessed art thou</I> because <I>blessed is the 
 fruit of thy womb;</I> thence it was that she derived this excelling 
 dignity. Elisabeth was the wife of a priest, and in years, yet she 
 <I>grudges</I> not that her kinswoman, who was many years younger than 
 she, and every way her inferior, should have the honour of conceiving 
 in her virginity, and being the mother of the Messiah, whereas the 
 honour put upon her was <I>much less;</I> she <I>rejoices</I> in it, 
 and is well pleased, as her son was afterwards, that she who <I>cometh 
 after her is preferred before her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:27">John i. 27</A>.

 Note, While we cannot but own that we are more <I>favoured</I> of God
 than we deserve, let us by no means envy that others are <I>more 
 highly</I> favoured than we are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She acknowledges her condescension, in making her this visit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>Whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to 
 me?</I> Observe, 

 (1.) She calls the virgin Mary the <I>mother of her Lord</I> (as David
 in spirit, called the Messiah Lord, <I>his Lord</I>), for she knew he 
 was to be <I>Lord of all.</I> 

 (2.) She not only bids her welcome to her house, though perhaps she 
 came in mean circumstances, but reckons this visit a great favour, 
 which she thought herself unworthy of. <I>Whence is this to me?</I> It 
 is in reality, and not in compliment, that she saith, "This was a 
 greater favour than I could have expected." Note, Those that are filled 
 with the Holy Ghost have <I>low thoughts</I> of their own merits, and 
 high thoughts of God's favours. Her son the Baptist spoke to the same 
 purport with this, when he said, <I>Comest thou to me?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:14">Matt. iii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She acquaints her with the concurrence of the babe in her womb, in 
 this welcome to her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 "Thou certainly bringest some extraordinary tidings, some extraordinary 
 blessing, with thee; for <I>as soon as the voice of thy salutation 
 sounded in my ears,</I> not only my heart <I>leaped for joy,</I> though 
 I knew not immediately why or wherefore, but the <I>babe in my 
 womb,</I> who was not capable of knowing, <I>did so</I> too." He 
 <I>leaped</I> as it were <I>for joy</I> that the Messiah, whose 
 harbinger he was to be, would himself come soon after him. This would 
 serve very much to strengthen the faith of the virgin, that there were 
 such assurances as these given to others; and it would be in part the 
 accomplishment of what had been so often foretold, that there should be 
 <I>universal joy before the Lord, when he cometh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:8,9">Ps. xcviii. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. She commends her faith, and encourages it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>):

 <I>Blessed is she that believed.</I> Believing souls are blessed souls, 
 and will be found so at last; this blessedness cometh <I>through 
 faith,</I> even the blessedness of being related to Christ, and having 
 him <I>formed in the soul.</I> They are <I>blessed</I> who 
 <I>believe</I> the word of God, for that Word will not fail them; 
 <I>there shall,</I> without doubt, <I>be a performance of those things 
 which are told her from the Lord.</I> Note, The inviolable certainty of 
 the promise is the undoubted felicity of those that build upon it and 
 expect their all from it. The faithfulness of God is the blessedness of 
 the faith of the saints. Those that have experienced the performance of 
 God's promises themselves should encourage others to hope that he will 
 be as good as his word to them also: <I>I will tell you what God has 
 done for my soul.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Mary's song of praise, upon this occasion. Elisabeth's prophecy was 
 an echo to the virgin Mary's salutation, and this song is yet a 
 stronger <I>echo</I> to that prophecy, and shows her to be no less 
 filled with the Holy Ghost than Elisabeth was. We may suppose the
 blessed virgin to come in, very much <I>fatigued</I> with her journey; 
 yet she forgets that, and is inspired with new life, and vigour, and 
 joy, upon the confirmation she here meets with of her faith; and since, 
 by the sudden inspiration and transport, she finds that this was 
 designed to be her errand hither, weary as she is, like Abraham's 
 servant, she would <I>neither eat nor drink till she had told her 
 errand.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here are the expressions of joy and praise, and God alone the object 
 of the praise and centre of the joy. Some compare this song with that 
 which her name-sake Miriam, the sister of Moses, sung, upon the 
 triumphant departure of Israel out of Egypt, and their triumphant 
 passage through the Red Sea; others think it better compared with the 
 song of Hannah, upon the birth of Samuel, which, like this, passes from 
 a family mercy to a public and general one. <I>This</I> begins, like 
 <I>that, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:1">1 Sam. ii. 1</A>.

 Observe how Mary here speaks of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) With great reverence of him, as <I>the Lord:</I> "<I>My soul doth 
 magnify the Lord;</I> I never saw him so <I>great</I> as now I find him 
 so <I>good.</I>" Note, Those, and those only, are <I>advanced</I> in 
 mercy, who are thereby brought to think the more <I>highly</I> and 
 <I>honourably</I> of God; whereas there are those whose prosperity and 
 preferment make them say, <I>What is the Almighty, that we should serve 
 him?</I> The more honour God has any way put upon us, the more honour 
 we must study to give to him; and <I>then</I> only are we accepted in 
 magnifying the Lord, when our <I>souls</I> magnify him, and <I>all that 
 is within us.</I> Praising work must be soul work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) With great complacency in him as <I>her Saviour: My spirit 
 rejoiceth in God my Saviour.</I> This seems to have reference to the 
 Messiah, whom she was to be the mother of. She calls him <I>God her 
 Saviour;</I> for the angel had told her that he should be the <I>Son of 
 the Highest,</I> and that his name should be <I>Jesus, a Saviour;</I> 
 this she fastened upon, with application to herself: <I>He is God my 
 Saviour.</I> Even the mother of our Lord had need of an interest in him 
 as her Saviour, and would have been undone without it: and she glories 
 more in that happiness which she had in common with all believers than 
 in being his mother, which was an honour peculiar to herself, and this 
 agrees with the preference Christ have to obedient believers above his 
 mother and brethren; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:50,Lu+11:27,28">Matt. xii. 50; Luke xi. 27, 28</A>.

 Note, Those that have Christ for their God and Saviour have a great 
 deal of reason to rejoice, to <I>rejoice in spirit,</I> that is 
 rejoicing as Christ did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:21">Luke x. 21</A>),

 with spiritual joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here are just causes assigned for this joy and praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Upon <I>her own</I> account, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:48,49"><I>v.</I> 48, 49</A>.

 [1.] Her <I>spirit rejoiced in the Lord,</I> because of the <I>kind</I>
 things he had done for her: his <I>condescension</I> and 
 <I>compassion</I> to her. <I>He has regarded the low estate of his 
 handmaiden;</I> that is, he has <I>looked</I> upon her <I>with 
 pity,</I> for so the word is commonly used. "He has chosen me to this 
 honour, notwithstanding my great meanness, poverty, and obscurity." 
 Nay, the expression seems to intimate, not only (to allude to that of 
 Gideon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:15">Judg. vi. 15</A>)

 that her <I>family</I> was poor in Judah, but that she was the <I>least 
 in her father's house,</I> as if she were under some particular 
 contempt and disgraced among her relations, was unjustly neglected, and 
 the outcast of the family, and God put this honour upon her, to balance 
 abundantly the contempt. I the rather suggest this, for we find 
 something toward such honour as this put upon others, on the like 
 consideration. Because God saw that Leah <I>was hated,</I> he <I>opened 
 her womb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:31">Gen. xxix. 31</A>.

 Because Hannah was provoked, and made to fret, and insulted over, by
 Peninnah, therefore God gave her a son,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:19">1 Sam. i. 19</A>.

 Whom men wrongfully depress and despise God doth sometimes, in
 compassion to them, especially if they have borne it patiently, prefer
 and advance; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:7">Judg. xi. 7</A>.

 So in Mary's case. And, if God <I>regards her low estate,</I> he not
 only thereby gives a specimen of his favour to the whole race of 
 mankind, whom he <I>remembers in their low estate,</I> as the psalmist 
 speaks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:23">Ps. cxxxvi. 23</A>),

 but secures a lasting honour to her (for such the honour is that God
 bestows, honour that fades not away): "<I>From henceforth all 
 generations shall call me blessed,</I> shall think me a happy woman and 
 highly advanced." All that embrace Christ and his gospel will say, 
 <I>Blessed was the womb that bore him and the paps which he sucked,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:27">Luke xi. 27</A>.

 Elizabeth had once and again called her <I>blessed:</I> "But that is
 not all," saith she, "all generations of Gentiles as well as Jews shall 
 call me so."

 [2.] Her <I>soul magnifies</I> the Lord, because of the 
 <I>wonderful</I> things he had done for her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):

 <I>He that is mighty has done to me great things.</I> A <I>great</I> 
 thing indeed, that a <I>virgin</I> should <I>conceive.</I> A 
 <I>great</I> thing indeed, that Messiah, who had been so long promised 
 to the church, and so long expected by the church, should now at length 
 be born. It is the <I>power of the Highest</I> that appears in this.
 She adds, <I>and holy is his name;</I> for so Hannah saith her song, 
 <I>There is none holy as the Lord,</I> which she explains in the next 
 words, <I>for there is none beside thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:2">1 Sam. ii. 2</A>.

 God is a Being <I>by himself,</I> and he manifests himself to be so,
 especially in the work of our redemption. He that is <I>mighty,</I>
 even he <I>whose name is holy,</I> has <I>done to me great things.</I> 
 Glorious things may be expected from him that is both <I>mighty</I> and 
 <I>holy;</I> who <I>can do every thing,</I> and <I>will</I> do every 
 thing <I>well</I> and <I>for the best.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Upon the account of <I>others.</I> The virgin Mary, as the mother 
 of the Messiah, is become a kind of public person, wears a public 
 character, and is therefore immediately endued with another spirit, a 
 more public spirit than before she had, and therefore <I>looks 
 abroad,</I> looks <I>about her,</I> looks <I>before her,</I> and takes 
 notice of God's various dealings with the children of men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>,

 &c.), as Hannah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:3">1 Sam. ii. 3</A>,

 &c.). In this she has especially an eye to the coming of the Redeemer
 and God's manifesting himself therein.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] It is a certain truth that God <I>has mercy in store,</I> mercy in 
 reserve, <I>for all that have a reverence for his majesty,</I> and a 
 due regard to his sovereignty and authority. But never did this appear 
 so as in sending his Son into the world to save us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>):

 <I>His mercy is on them that fear him;</I> it has always been so; he 
 has ever looked upon <I>them</I> with an eye of <I>peculiar favour</I> 
 who have looked up to him with and eye of <I>filial fear.</I> But he 
 hath manifested this <I>mercy,</I> so as never before, in sending his 
 Son to bring in an everlasting righteousness, and work out an 
 everlasting salvation, for them that fear him, and this <I>from 
 generation to generation;</I> for there are gospel privileges 
 transmitted by entail, and intended for perpetuity. Those that <I>fear 
 God,</I> as their Creator and Judge, are encouraged to hope for 
 <I>mercy in him,</I> through their Mediator and Advocate; and in him 
 <I>mercy</I> is settled upon all that <I>fear God,</I> pardoning mercy, 
 healing mercy, accepting mercy, crowning mercy, <I>from generation to 
 generation,</I> while the world stands. In Christ he <I>keepeth mercy 
 for thousands.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It has been a common observation that God in his providence puts 
 <I>contempt</I> upon the <I>haughty</I> and <I>honour</I> upon the 
 <I>humble;</I> and this he has done remarkably in the whole economy of 
 the work of man's redemption. As God had, with his <I>mercy</I> to her, 
 shown himself <I>mighty</I> also 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:48,49"><I>v.</I> 48, 49</A>),

 so he had, with his <I>mercy on them that fear him, shown strength</I> 
 likewise <I>with his arm.</I> <I>First,</I> In the course of his 
 providence, it is his usual method to cross <I>the expectations of 
 men,</I> and proceed quite otherwise than they promise themselves. 
 <I>Proud men</I> expect to carry all before them, to have their way and 
 their will; but he <I>scatters them in the imagination of their 
 hearts,</I> breaks their measures, blasts their projects, nay, and 
 brings them low, and brings them down, by those very counsels with 
 which they thought to advance and establish themselves. The 
 <I>mighty</I> think to secure themselves by might <I>in their 
 seats,</I> but he <I>puts them down,</I> and overturns their seats; 
 while, on the other hand, those of <I>low degree,</I> who despaired of 
 ever advancing themselves, and thought of no other than of being 
 <I>ever low,</I> are wonderfully <I>exalted.</I> This observation 
 concerning <I>honour</I> holds likewise concerning <I>riches;</I> many 
 who were so poor that they had not bread for themselves and their 
 families, by some surprising turn of Providence in favour of them, come 
 to be <I>filled with good things;</I> while, on the other hand, those 
 who were rich, and thought no other than that to-morrow should be as 
 this day, that their mountain stood strong and should never be moved, 
 are strangely impoverished, and <I>sent away empty.</I> Now this is the 
 same observation that Hannah had made, and enlarged upon, in her song, 
 with application to the case of herself and her adversary 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:4-7">1 Sam. ii. 4-7</A>),
 
 which very much illustrates this here. And compare also 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:33-41,113:7-9,Ec+9:11">Ps. cvii. 33-41; cxiii. 7-9;
 and Eccl. ix. 11</A>.

 God takes a pleasure in <I>disappointing</I> their expectations who 
 promise themselves <I>great things</I> in the world, and in 
 <I>out-doing</I> the expectations of those who promise themselves but 
 <I>a little;</I> as a <I>righteous</I> God, it is his glory to 
 <I>abase</I> those who <I>exalt</I> themselves, and strike terror on 
 the secure; and, as a <I>good</I> God, it is his glory to exalt those 
 who humble themselves, and to speak comfort to those who fear before 
 him. <I>Secondly,</I> This doth especially appear in the methods of 
 gospel grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In the <I>spiritual honours</I> it dispenses. When the proud 
 Pharisees were rejected, and Publicans and sinners went <I>into the 
 kingdom of heaven</I> before them,--when the Jews, who <I>followed after
 the law of righteousness,</I> did not attain it, and the Gentiles, who 
 never thought of it, attained to righteousness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:30,31">Rom. ix. 30, 31</A>),--when
 
 God chose not the <I>wise men after the flesh,</I> not the 
 <I>mighty,</I> or the <I>noble,</I> to preach the gospel, and plant 
 Christianity in the world, but the <I>foolish</I> and <I>weak</I> 
 things of the world, and things that were despised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:26,27">1 Cor. i. 26, 27</A>)--then

 he <I>scattered the proud,</I> and <I>put down the mighty,</I> but 
 <I>exalted them of low degree.</I> When the tyranny of the chief 
 priests and elders were brought down, who had long <I>lorded it over 
 God's heritage,</I> and hoped <I>always</I> to do so, and Christ's 
 disciples, a company of poor despised fishermen, by the power they were 
 clothed with, were made to <I>sit on thrones,</I> judging the twelve 
 tribes of Israel,--when the power of the four monarchies was broken, 
 and the kingdom of the Messiah, that <I>stone cut out of the mountain 
 without hands,</I> is made to <I>fill the earth,</I>--then are the 
 <I>proud scattered,</I> and those of low degree <I>exalted.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In the <I>spiritual riches</I> it dispenses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.

 (1.) Those who see their need of Christ, and are importunately desirous
 of righteousness and life in him, he <I>fills</I> with <I>good 
 things,</I> with the <I>best things;</I> he gives liberally to them, 
 and they are <I>abundantly satisfied</I> with the blessings he gives. 
 Those who are weary and heavy-laden shall find rest with Christ, and 
 those who thirst are called to <I>come to him and drink;</I> for they 
 only know how to value his gifts. <I>To the hungry soul every bitter 
 thing is sweet,</I> manna is angels' food; and to the <I>thirsty</I> 
 fair water is <I>honey out of the rock.</I> 

 (2.) Those who are rich, who are not <I>hungry,</I> who, like Laodicea, 
 think they have <I>need of nothing,</I> are full of themselves and 
 their own righteousness, and think they have a sufficiency in 
 themselves, those he <I>sends away</I> from his door, they are not 
 welcome to him, he sends them <I>empty</I> away, they come <I>full of 
 self,</I> and are sent away <I>empty of Christ.</I> He sends them to 
 the <I>gods whom they served,</I> to their own righteousness and 
 strength which they trusted to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] It was always expected that the Messiah should be, in a special 
 manner, the strength and glory of his people Israel, and so he is in a 
 peculiar manner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>):

 <I>He hath helped his servant Israel,</I> <B><I>antelabeto</I></B>. He 
 hath taken them by the hand, and <I>helped them up</I> that were fallen 
 and could not help themselves. Those that were sunk under the burdens 
 of a broken covenant of innocency are <I>helped up</I> by the blessings 
 of a renewed covenant of grace. The sending of the Messiah, on whom 
 <I>help</I> was <I>laid</I> for poor sinners, was the greatest kindness 
 that could be done, the greatest help that could be provided for his 
 people Israel, and that which magnifies it is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> That it is <I>in remembrance of his mercy,</I> the 
 mercifulness of his nature, the mercy he has in store for <I>his 
 servant Israel.</I> While this blessing was deferred, his people, who 
 waited for it, were often ready to ask, <I>Has God forgotten to be 
 gracious?</I> But now he made it appear that he had not forgotten, but 
 <I>remembered, his mercy.</I> He remembered his former mercy, and 
 repeated that to them in <I>spiritual</I> blessings which he had done 
 formerly to them in <I>temporal</I> favours. <I>He remembered the days 
 of old. Where is he that brought them up out of the sea,</I> out of 
 Egypt? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:11">Isa. lxiii. 11</A>.

 He will do the like again, which that was a type of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> That it is <I>in performance of his promise.</I> It is 
 a mercy not only designed, but declared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>);

 it was <I>what he spoke to our fathers,</I> that the Seed of the woman 
 should break the head of the serpent; that God should dwell in the 
 tents of Shem; and particularly to Abraham, that <I>in his seed all the 
 families of the earth shall be blessed,</I> with the best of blessings, 
 with the blessings that are <I>for ever,</I> and to the seed that shall 
 be for ever; that is, his <I>spiritual</I> seed, for his carnal seed 
 were <I>cut off</I> a little after this. Note, What God has spoken he 
 will perform; what he hath spoken to the fathers will be performed to 
 their seed; to their seed's seed, in blessings that shall last for 
 ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Mary's return to Nazareth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>),

 after she had continued with Elisabeth about <I>three months,</I> so 
 long as to be fully satisfied concerning herself that she was <I>with 
 child,</I> and to be confirmed therein by her cousin Elisabeth. Some 
 think, though her return is here mentioned before Elisabeth's being 
 delivered, because the evangelist would finish this passage concerning 
 Mary before he proceeded with the story of Elisabeth, yet that Mary 
 staid till her cousin was (as we say) <I>down and up again;</I> that 
 she might attend on her, and be with her in her lying-in, and have her 
 own faith confirmed by the full accomplishment of the promise of God 
 concerning Elisabeth. But most bind themselves to the order of the 
 story as it lies, and think she returned again when Elisabeth was near 
 her time; because she still affected retirement, and therefore would 
 not be there when the birth of this child of promise would draw a great 
 deal of company to the house. Those in whose hearts Christ is formed 
 take more delight than they used to do in <I>sitting alone</I> and 
 <I>keeping silence.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>57  Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered;
 and she brought forth a son.
 &nbsp; 58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had
 showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
 &nbsp; 59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
 circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the
 name of his father.
 &nbsp; 60 And his mother answered and said, Not <I>so;</I> but he shall be
 called John.
 &nbsp; 61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is
 called by this name.
 &nbsp; 62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him
 called.
 &nbsp; 63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His
 name is John. And they marvelled all.
 &nbsp; 64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue
 <I>loosed,</I> and he spake, and praised God.
 &nbsp; 65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all
 these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country
 of Jud&aelig;a.
 &nbsp; 66 And all they that heard <I>them</I> laid <I>them</I> up in their
 hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand
 of the Lord was with him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The birth of John Baptist, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>.

 Though he was conceived in the womb by miracle, he continued in the
 womb according to the ordinary course of nature (so did our Saviour): 
 <I>Elisabeth's full time came, that she should be delivered,</I> and 
 then <I>she brought forth a son.</I> Promised mercies are to be 
 expected when the <I>full time</I> for them is come, and not 
 before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great joy that was among all the relations of the family, upon
 this extraordinary occasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>):

 <I>Her neighbours and her cousins heard of it;</I> for it would be in
 every body's mouth, as next to miraculous. Dr. Lightfoot observes that 
 Hebron was inhabited by priests of the family of Aaron, and that those 
 were the cousins here spoken of; but the fields and villages about, by 
 the children of Judah, and that those were the <I>neighbours.</I> Now 
 these here discovered, 

 1. A <I>pious</I> regard to God. They acknowledged that <I>the Lord had
 magnified his mercy to her,</I> so the word is. It was a mercy to have 
 her reproach taken away, a mercy to have her family built up, and the 
 more being a family of <I>priests,</I> devoted to God, and employed for 
 him. Many things concurred to make the mercy <I>great</I>--that she had 
 been long barren, was now old, but especially that the child should be 
 <I>great in the sight of the Lord.</I> 

 2. A <I>friendly</I> regard to Elisabeth. When she rejoiced, they
 <I>rejoiced with her.</I> We ought to take <I>pleasure</I> in the 
 prosperity of our neighbours and friends, and to be thankful to God for 
 <I>their</I> comforts as for our own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The dispute that was among them concerning the naming him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>):
 
 <I>On the eighth day,</I> as God has appointed, they <I>came 
 together,</I> to <I>circumcise the child;</I> it was here, in Hebron, 
 that <I>circumcision</I> was first instituted; and Isaac, who, like 
 John Baptist, was born <I>by promise,</I> was one of the first that was 
 submitted to it, at least the chief eyed in the institution of it. They 
 that rejoiced in the birth of the child came together to the 
 circumcising of him. Note, The greatest comfort we can take in our 
 children is in <I>giving them up to God,</I> and recognizing their 
 covenant-relation to him. The baptism of our children should be more 
 our joy than their birth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now it was the custom, when they circumcised their children, to <I>name 
 them,</I> because, when <I>Abram</I> was circumcised God gave him a new 
 name, and called him <I>Abraham;</I> and it is not unfit that they 
 should be left <I>nameless</I> till they are by name <I>given up to 
 God.</I> Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Some</I> proposed that he should be called by his father's name, 
 <I>Zacharias.</I> We have not any instance in scripture that the child 
 should bear the father's name; but perhaps it was of late come into use 
 among the Jews, at it is with us, and they intended hereby to do honour 
 to the father, who was not likely to have another child.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>mother</I> opposed it, and would have called him <I>John;</I> 
 having learned, either by inspiration of the Holy Ghost (as is most 
 probable), or by information in writing from her husband, that God 
 appointed this to be his name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>);

 He shall be called <I>Johanan--Gracious,</I> because he shall introduce 
 the gospel of Christ, wherein God's grace shines more brightly than 
 ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The <I>relations</I> objected against that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>):

 "<I>There is none of thy kindred,</I> none of the relations of thy 
 family, <I>that is called by that name;</I> and therefore, if he may 
 not have his father's name, yet let him have the name of some of his 
 kindred, who will take it as a piece of respect to have such a <I>child 
 of wonders</I> as this named from them." Note, As those that <I>have 
 friends</I> must <I>show themselves friendly,</I> so those that have 
 relations must be <I>obliging</I> to them in all the usual regards that 
 are paid to <I>kindred.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They appealed to the <I>father,</I> and would try if they could 
 possibly get to know his mind; for it was his office to <I>name the 
 child,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>.

 They <I>made signs</I> to him, by which it appears that he was 
 <I>deaf</I> as well as <I>dumb;</I> nay, it should seem, 
 <I>mindless</I> of any thing, else one would think they should at first 
 have desired him to write down his child's name, if he had ever 
 communicated any thing by writing since he was <I>struck.</I> However, 
 they would carry the matter as far as they could, and therefore gave 
 him to understand what the dispute was which he only could determine; 
 whereupon he made signs to them to give him a <I>table-book,</I> such 
 as they then used, and with the pencil he wrote these words, <I>His 
 name is John,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:63"><I>v.</I> 63</A>.

 Note, "It shall be so," or, "I would have it so," but "It is so." The 
 matter is determined already; the <I>angel</I> had given him that name. 
 Observe, When Zacharias could not <I>speak,</I> he <I>wrote.</I> When 
 ministers have their mouths stopped, that they cannot preach, yet they 
 may be doing good as long as they have not their hands tied, that they 
 cannot write. Many of the martyrs in prison wrote letters to their 
 friends, which were of great use; blessed Paul himself did so. 
 Zacharias's pitching upon the same name that Elisabeth had chosen was a 
 great surprise to the company: <I>They marvelled all;</I> for they knew 
 not that, though by reason of his deafness and dumbness they could not 
 <I>converse together,</I> yet they were both guided by <I>one and the 
 same Spirit:</I> or perhaps they <I>marvelled</I> that he wrote so 
 distinctly and intelligently, which (the stroke he was under being 
 somewhat like that of a palsy) he had not done before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He thereupon recovered the use of his speech 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:64"><I>v.</I> 64</A>):

 <I>His mouth was opened immediately.</I> The time prefixed for his 
 being silenced was <I>till the day that these blessed things shall be 
 fulfilled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 not <I>all the things</I> going before concerning John's ministry, but
 those which relate to his birth and name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>).

 That time was now expired, whereupon the restraint was taken off, and 
 God gave him the <I>opening of the mouth again,</I> as he did to 
 Ezekiel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:27"><I>ch.</I> iii. 27</A>.

 Dr. Lightfoot compares this case of Zacharias with that of Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:24-26">Exod. iv. 24-26</A>.

 Moses, for distrust, is in danger of his life, as Zacharias, for the
 same fault, is <I>struck dumb;</I> but, upon the circumcision of his 
 child, and recovery of his faith, there, as here, the danger is 
 removed. Infidelity closed his mouth, and now believing opens it again; 
 <I>he believes, therefore he speaks.</I> David lay under guilt from the 
 conception of his child till a few days after its birth; then <I>the 
 Lord takes away his sin:</I> upon his repentance, he shall not die. So 
 here he shall be no longer dumb; <I>his mouth was opened, and he spoke, 
 and praised God.</I> Note, When God opens our lips, our mouths must 
 <I>show forth his praise.</I> As good be without our speech as not use 
 it in <I>praising God;</I> for then our tongue is most <I>our glory</I> 
 when it is employed for <I>God's glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. These things were told all the country over, to the great amazement 
 of all that heard them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:65,66"><I>v.</I> 65, 66</A>.

 The sentiments of the people are not to be slighted, but taken notice 
 of. We are here told,

 (1.) That <I>these sayings were discoursed of,</I> and were the common
 talk all about the <I>hill-country of Judea.</I> It is a pity but a 
 narrative of them had been drawn up, and published in the world, 
 immediately. 

 (2.) That most people who heard of these things were put into 
 consternation by them: <I>Fear came on all them that dwell round 
 about</I> there. If we have not a <I>good hope,</I> as we ought to 
 have, built upon the gospel, we may expect that the tidings of it will 
 fill us with <I>fear.</I> They believed and trembled, whereas they 
 should have believed and triumphed. 

 (3.) It raised the expectations of people concerning this child, and 
 obliged them to have their eye upon him, to see what he would come to. 
 They <I>laid up these</I> presages <I>in their hearts,</I> treasured 
 them up in mind and memory, as foreseeing they should hereafter have 
 occasion to <I>recollect</I> them. Note, What we hear, that may be of 
 use to us, we should <I>treasure</I> up, that we may be able to bring 
 forth, for the benefit of others, things new and old, and, when things 
 come to perfection, may be able to look back upon the presages thereof, 
 and to say, "It was what we might expect." They said <I>within</I> 
 themselves, and said <I>among</I> themselves, "<I>What manner of child 
 shall this be?</I> What will be the fruit when these are the buds, or 
 rather when the <I>root</I> is out of such a <I>dry ground?</I>" Note, 
 When children are born into the world, it is very uncertain what they 
 will prove; yet sometimes there have been early indications of 
 something great, as in the birth of Moses, Samson, Samuel, and here of 
 John. And we have reason to think that there were some of those living 
 at the time when John began his public ministry who could, and did, 
 remember these things, and relate them to others, which contributed as 
 much as any thing to the great flocking there was after him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> It is said, <I>The hand of the Lord was with him;</I> 
 that is, he was taken under the special protection of the Almighty, 
 from his birth, as one designed for something great and considerable, 
 and there were many instances of it. It appeared likewise that the 
 Spirit was at work upon his soul very early. As soon as he began to 
 speak or go, you might perceive something in him very extraordinary. 
 Note, God has ways of operating upon children in their infancy, which 
 we cannot account for. God never made a soul but he knew how to
 sanctify it.</P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>67  And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
 prophesied, saying,
 &nbsp; 68 Blessed <I>be</I> the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and
 redeemed his people,
 &nbsp; 69 And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house
 of his servant David;
 &nbsp; 70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have
 been since the world began:
 &nbsp; 71 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand
 of all that hate us;
 &nbsp; 72 To perform the mercy <I>promised</I> to our fathers, and to
 remember his holy covenant;
 &nbsp; 73 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,
 &nbsp; 74 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of
 the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,
 &nbsp; 75 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of
 our life.
 &nbsp; 76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:
 for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his
 ways;
 &nbsp; 77 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the
 remission of their sins,
 &nbsp; 78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
 from on high hath visited us,
 &nbsp; 79 To give light to them that sit in darkness and <I>in</I> the
 shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
 &nbsp; 80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in
 the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the song wherewith Zacharias <I>praised God</I> when his 
 <I>mouth</I> was <I>opened;</I> in it he is said to <I>prophesy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:67"><I>v.</I> 67</A>),

 and so he did in the strictest sense of <I>prophesying;</I> for he 
 foretold things to come concerning the kingdom of the Messiah, to which 
 all the prophets bear witness. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he was qualified for this: <I>He was filled with the Holy 
 Ghost,</I> was endued with more than ordinary measures and degrees of 
 it, for this purpose; he was divinely inspired. God not only 
 <I>forgave</I> him his unbelief and distrust (which was signified by 
 discharging him from the punishment of it), but, as a <I>specimen</I> 
 of the <I>abounding</I> of grace towards believers, he <I>filled 
 him</I> with the <I>Holy Ghost,</I> and put this honour upon him, to 
 employ him for his honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the matter of his song was. Here is nothing said of the 
 private concerns of his own family, the rolling away of the reproach 
 from it and putting of a reputation upon it, by the birth of this 
 child, though, no doubt, he found a time to give thanks to God for 
 this, with his family; but in this song he is wholly taken up with the 
 kingdom of the Messiah, and the public blessings to be introduced by 
 it. He could have little pleasure in this <I>fruitfulness</I> of his 
 <I>vine,</I> and the <I>hopefulness</I> of his <I>olive-plant,</I> if 
 herein he had not foreseen the <I>good of Jerusalem, peace upon 
 Israel,</I> and <I>blessings</I> on both <I>out of Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:3,5,6">Ps. cxxviii. 3, 5, 6</A>.

 The Old-Testament prophesies are often expressed in <I>praises</I> and
 <I>new songs,</I> so is the beginning of New-Testament prophecy: 
 <I>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel. The God of the whole earth shall 
 he be called;</I> yet Zacharias, speaking of the work of redemption, 
 called him the <I>Lord God of Israel,</I> because to Israel the 
 prophecies, promises, and types, of the redemption had hitherto been 
 given, and to them the first proffers and proposals of it were now to 
 be made. Israel, as a chosen people, was a type of the <I>elect of 
 God</I> out of all nations, whom God had a particular eye to, in 
 sending the Saviour; and therefore he is therein called the <I>Lord God 
 of Israel.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now Zacharias here blesses God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For the work of <I>salvation</I> that was to be wrought out by the 
 Messiah himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:68-75"><I>v.</I> 68-75</A>.

 This it is that <I>fills him,</I> when he is <I>filled with the Holy 
 Ghost,</I> and it is that which all who have the <I>Spirit of 
 Christ</I> are <I>full of.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In sending the Messiah, God has <I>made a gracious visit</I> to 
 his people, whom for many ages he had seemed to neglect, and to be 
 estranged from; he hath <I>visited them</I> as a friend, to take 
 cognizance of their case. God is said to have <I>visited</I> his people 
 in bondage when he <I>delivered</I> them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:16,4:31">Exod. iii. 16; iv. 31</A>),

 to have <I>visited</I> his people in famine when he <I>gave them 
 bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:6">Ruth i. 6</A>.

 He had often sent to them by his prophets, and had still kept up a 
 correspondence with them; but now he himself made them a 
 <I>visit.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He has <I>wrought out redemption</I> for them: <I>He has redeemed 
 his people.</I> This was the errand on which Christ <I>came into the 
 world,</I> to redeem those that were sold <I>for</I> sin, and sold 
 <I>under</I> sin; even God's own people, his Israel, his son, his 
 <I>first-born,</I> his <I>free-born,</I> need to be <I>redeemed,</I> 
 and are undone if they be not. Christ redeems them by <I>price</I> out 
 of the hands of God's justice, and redeems them by <I>power</I> out of 
 the hands of Satan's tyranny, as Israel out of Egypt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He has fulfilled the <I>covenant of royalty</I> made with the most 
 famous <I>Old-Testament prince,</I> that is, David. Glorious things had 
 been said of his family, that on him, as a <I>mighty one, help</I> 
 should be <I>laid,</I> that <I>his horn should be exalted,</I> and his 
 <I>seed</I> perpetuated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:19,20,24,29">Ps. lxxxix. 19, 20, 24, 29</A>.

 But that family had been long in a manner <I>cast off</I> and
 <I>abhorred,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:38">Ps. lxxxix. 38</A>.

 Now here it is glorified in, that, according to the promise, the 
 <I>horn</I> of David should again be <I>made to bud;</I> for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:17">Ps. cxxxii. 17</A>,

 he <I>hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his 
 servant David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:69"><I>v.</I> 69</A>),

 there, where it was promised and expected to arise. David is called
 God's <I>servant,</I> not only as a good man, but as a king that 
 <I>ruled for God;</I> and he was an instrument of the <I>salvation</I> 
 of Israel, by being employed in the <I>government</I> of Israel; so 
 Christ is the <I>author of eternal redemption to those</I> only <I>that 
 obey him.</I> There is in Christ, and in him only, <I>salvation for 
 us,</I> and it is a <I>horn of salvation;</I> for,

 [1.] It is an <I>honourable</I> salvation. It is <I>raised up</I> above 
 all other salvations, none of which are to be compared with it: in it 
 the glory both of the Redeemer and of the redeemed are advanced, and 
 their <I>horn exalted with honour.</I> 

 [2.] It is a <I>plentiful salvation.</I> It is a <I>cornucopia--a horn 
 of plenty,</I> a <I>salvation</I> in which we are blessed with 
 <I>spiritual</I> blessings, in <I>heavenly things,</I> abundantly. 

 [3.] It is a <I>powerful salvation:</I> the strength of the beast is in 
 his <I>horn.</I> He has raised up such a salvation as shall <I>pull 
 down</I> our spiritual enemies, and <I>protect</I> us from them. In the 
 <I>chariots</I> of this <I>salvation</I> the Redeemer shall go forth, 
 and go on, <I>conquering and to conquer.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He has fulfilled all the precious promises made to the church by 
 the most famous <I>Old-Testament prophets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:70"><I>v.</I> 70</A>):

 <I>As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets.</I> His doctrine of 
 salvation by the Messiah is confirmed by an appeal to the prophets, and 
 the greatness and importance of that salvation thereby evidenced and 
 magnified; it is the same that they spoke of, which therefore ought to 
 be expected and welcomed; it is what they <I>enquired and searched 
 diligently after</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10,11">1 Pet. i. 10, 11</A>),

 which therefore ought not to be slighted or thought meanly of. God is 
 now <I>doing</I> that which he has long ago <I>spoken of;</I> and 
 therefore <I>be silent, O all flesh, before him,</I> and attend to him. 
 See,

 [1.] How <I>sacred</I> the prophecies of this salvation were. The 
 prophets who delivered them were <I>holy prophets,</I> who durst not 
 deceive and who aimed at promoting holiness among men; and it was the 
 <I>holy God</I> himself that <I>spoke by</I> them. 

 [2.] How <I>ancient</I> they were: ever <I>since the world began.</I> 
 God having promised, when the world began, that the <I>Seed of the 
 woman should break the serpent's head,</I> that promise was echoed to 
 when Adam called his wife's name <I>Eve-Life,</I> for the sake of that 
 Seed of hers; when Eve called her first son <I>Cain,</I> saying, <I>I 
 have gotten a man from the Lord,</I> and another son, Seth, 
 <I>settled;</I> when Noah was called <I>rest,</I> and foretold that God 
 should dwell in the tents of Shem. And it was not long after the new 
 world began in Noah that the promise was made to Abraham that in his 
 Seed the <I>nations of the earth</I> should be <I>blessed.</I> 

 [3.] What a wonderful <I>harmony</I> and <I>concert</I> we perceive 
 among them. God spoke the same thing by them all, and therefore it is 
 said to be <B><I>dia stomatos</I></B>, not by the <I>mouths,</I> but by 
 the <I>mouth,</I> of the prophets, for they all speak of Christ as it 
 were with <I>one mouth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now what is this <I>salvation</I> which was prophesied of?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> It is a <I>rescue</I> from the malice of <I>our 
 enemies;</I> it is <B><I>soterian ex echthron hemon</I></B>--<I>a
 salvation out of our enemies,</I> from among them, and <I>out of the 
 power of them that hate us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:71"><I>v.</I> 71</A>);

 it is a salvation from sin, and the dominion of Satan over us, both by 
 corruptions within and temptations without. The carnal Jews expected to 
 be delivered from under the Roman yoke, but intimation was betimes 
 given that it should be a redemption of another nature. He shall 
 <I>save his people from their sins,</I> that they may not have dominion 
 over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21">Matt. i. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> It is a <I>restoration</I> to the <I>favour of 
 God;</I> it is to <I>perform the mercy promised to our forefathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:72"><I>v.</I> 72</A>.

 The Redeemer shall not only break the head of the serpent that was the
 author of our ruin, but he shall <I>re-instate</I> us in the <I>mercy
 of God</I> and <I>re-establish</I> us in <I>his covenant;</I> he shall
 bring us as it were into a paradise again, which was signified by the
 <I>promises</I> made to the patriarchs, and the <I>holy covenant</I>
 made with them, <I>the oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:73"><I>v.</I> 73</A>.

 Observe,

 1. That which was promised to the fathers, and is performed to us, is
 <I>mercy,</I> pure mercy; nothing in it is owing to our <I>merit</I> 
 (we deserve wrath and the curse), but all to the <I>mercy</I> of God, 
 which <I>designed</I> us grace and life: <I>ex mero motu--of his own 
 good pleasure,</I> he loved us because he would love us. 

 2. God herein had an eye to <I>his covenant,</I> his <I>holy</I> 
 covenant, that covenant with Abraham: <I>I will be a God to thee and 
 thy seed.</I> This his seed had <I>really forfeited</I> by their 
 transgressions; this he <I>seemed to have forgotten</I> in the 
 calamities brought upon them; but he will now <I>remember</I> it, will 
 make it appear that he remembers it, for upon that are grounded all his 
 returns of mercy: 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42">Lev. xxvi. 42</A>,

 <I>Then will I remember my covenant.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> It is a qualification for, and an encouragement to, the 
 service of God. Thus was <I>the oath he sware to our Father 
 Abraham,</I> That he would <I>give us</I> power and grace to <I>serve 
 him,</I> in an acceptable manner to him and a comfortable manner to 
 ourselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74,75"><I>v.</I> 74, 75</A>.

 Here seems to be an allusion to the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, 
 which, God tells Moses, was in pursuance of the covenant he made with 
 Abraham

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:6-8">Exod. iii. 6-8</A>),

 and that this was the design of his bringing them out of Egypt, <I>that 
 they might serve God upon this mountain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:12">Exod. iii. 12</A>.

 Note, The great design of gospel grace is not to discharge us from, but 
 to engage us to, and encourage us in, the service of God. Under this 
 notion Christianity was always to be looked upon, as intended to make 
 us truly religious, to admit us into the service of God, to bind us to 
 it, and to quicken us in it. We are <I>therefore</I> delivered from the 
 iron yoke of sin, that our necks may be put under the sweet and easy 
 yoke of the Lord Jesus. <I>The very bonds which he has loosed do bind 
 us faster unto him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:16">Ps. cxvi. 16</A>.
 
 We are hereby enabled,

 1. To serve God <I>without fear</I>--<B><I>aphobos</I></B>. We are
 <I>therefore</I> put into a state of <I>holy safety</I> that we might 
 serve God with a <I>holy security</I> and <I>serenity of mind,</I> as 
 those that are <I>quiet from the fears of evil.</I> God must be served 
 with a <I>filial fear,</I> a reverent obedient fear, an awakening 
 quickening fear, but not with a <I>slavish fear,</I> like that of the 
 slothful servant, who represented him to himself as a <I>hard 
 master,</I> and unreasonable; not with that fear that has 
 <I>torment</I> and <I>amazement</I> in it; not with the fear of a legal 
 spirit; a <I>spirit of bondage,</I> but with the boldness of an 
 evangelical spirit, <I>a spirit of adoption.</I> 

 2. To serve him in <I>holiness and righteousness,</I> which includes
 the whole duty of man towards God and our neighbour. It is both the 
 intention and the direct tendency of the gospel to renew upon us that 
 image of God in which man was at first made, which consisted <I>in 
 righteousness and true holiness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:14">Ps. l. 14</A>.

 3. To serve him, <I>before him,</I> in the duties of his
 <I>immediate</I> worship, wherein we present ourselves <I>before the
 Lord,</I> to serve him as those that have an eye always upon him, and
 see his eye always upon us, upon our inward man, that is serving him
 <I>before him.</I> 

 4. To serve him <I>all the days of our life.</I> The design of the
 gospel is to engage us in constancy and perseverance in the service of
 God, by showing us how much depends upon our not drawing back, and by
 showing us how Christ <I>loved us to the end,</I> and thereby engaged
 us to <I>love him to the end.</I></P>

 2. He <I>blessed God</I> for the work of <I>preparation</I> for this
 salvation, which was to be done by John Baptist

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:76"><I>v.</I> 76</A>):

 <I>Thou child,</I> though now but a child of eight days' old, shalt be
 called <I>the prophet of the Highest.</I> Jesus Christ is <I>the 
 Highest,</I> for he is <I>God over all, blessed for evermore</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:5">Rom. ix. 5</A>),

 equal with the Father. John Baptist was <I>his prophet,</I> as Aaron 
 was Moses's prophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:1">Exod. vii. 1</A>);

 what he said was as his mouth, what he did was as his harbinger. 
 Prophecy had now long ceased, but in John it <I>revived,</I> as it had 
 done in Samuel, who was born of an aged mother, as John was, after a 
 long cessation. John's business was,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To prepare people for the salvation, by preaching repentance and 
 reformation as great gospel duties: <I>Thou shalt go before the face of 
 the Lord,</I> and but a little before him, to <I>prepare his ways,</I> 
 to call people to make room for him, and get ready for his 
 entertainment. Let every thing that may obstruct his progress, or 
 embarrass it, or hinder people from coming to him, be taken away: see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3,4">Isa. xl. 3, 4</A>.

 Let <I>valleys be filled,</I> and <I>hills</I> be brought
 <I>low.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To give people a general idea of the salvation, that they might 
 know, not only what to do, but what to expect; for the doctrine he 
 preached was that the <I>kingdom of heaven</I> is at hand. There are 
 two things in which you must know that this salvation consists:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The <I>forgiveness</I> of what we have <I>done amiss.</I> It is 
 salvation <I>by the remission of sins,</I> those sins which stand in 
 the way of the salvation, and by which we are all become liable to ruin 
 and condemnation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:77"><I>v.</I> 77</A>.

 John Baptist gave people to understand that, though their case was sad, 
 by reason of sin, it was not desperate, for pardon might be obtained 
 <I>through the tender mercy of our God</I> (the <I>bowels of mercy,</I> 
 so the word is): there was nothing in us but a <I>piteous case</I> to 
 recommend us to the divine compassion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>Direction</I> to <I>do better</I> for the time to come. The 
 gospel salvation not only encourages us to hope that the works of 
 darkness shall be forgiven us, but sets up a clear and true light, by 
 which we may order our steps aright. In it <I>the day-spring hath 
 visited us from on high</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:78"><I>v.</I> 78</A>);

 and this also is owing to the <I>tender mercy of our God.</I> Christ is 
 <B><I>anatole</I></B>--<I>the morning Light,</I> the <I>rising Sun,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:2">Mal. iv. 2</A>.
 
 The gospel brings <I>light</I> with it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:19">John iii. 19</A>),

 leaves us not to wander in the darkness of Pagan ignorance, or in the
 moonlight of the Old-Testament types or figures, but in it the day 
 dawns; in John Baptist it began to break, but increased apace, and 
 <I>shone more and more to the perfect day.</I> We have as much reason 
 to welcome the gospel day who enjoy it as those have to welcome the 
 morning who had long waited for it. <I>First,</I> The gospel is
 <I>discovering;</I> it shows us that which before we were utterly in 
 the dark about 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:79"><I>v.</I> 79</A>);

 it is to <I>give light to them that sit in darkness,</I> the <I>light 
 of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ;</I> 
 the day-spring <I>visited</I> this dark world to <I>lighten the 
 Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:18">Acts xxvi. 18</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> It is <I>reviving;</I> it brings light to them that
 sit <I>in the shadow of death,</I> as condemned prisoners in the 
 dungeon, to bring them the tidings of a <I>pardon,</I> at least of a 
 <I>reprieve</I> and opportunity of procuring a pardon; it proclaims the 
 <I>opening of the prison</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>),

 brings the <I>light of life.</I> How pleasant is that light!
 <I>Thirdly,</I> It is <I>directing;</I> it is to <I>guide our feet in 
 the way of peace,</I> into that way which will bring us to peace at 
 last. It is not only a light <I>to our eyes,</I> but a light <I>to our 
 feet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:105">Ps. cxix. 105</A>);

 it guides us into the way of making our peace with God, of keeping up a 
 comfortable communion; that <I>way of peace</I> which as sinners we 
 have wandered from and <I>have not known</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:17">Rom. iii. 17</A>),

 nor could ever have known of ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:80">last verse</A>,

 we have short account of the younger years of John Baptist. Though he
 was the son of a priest, he did not, like Samuel, go up, when he was a 
 child, to minister before the Lord; for he was to prepare the way for a 
 better priesthood. But we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Of his <I>eminence</I> as to the <I>inward man:</I> The <I>child 
 grew</I> in the capacities of his mind, much more than other children; 
 so that he <I>waxed strong in the spirit;</I> had a strong judgment and 
 strong resolution. Reason and conscience (both which are the candle of
 the Lord) were so strong in him that he had the inferior faculties of 
 appetite and passion in complete subjection betimes. By this it 
 appeared that he was betimes <I>filled with the Holy Ghost;</I> for 
 those that are strong in the Lord are <I>strong in spirit.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Of his <I>obscurity</I> as to the <I>outward man:</I> He <I>was in 
 the deserts;</I> not that he lived a hermit; cut off from the society 
 of men. No, we have reason to think that he went up to Jerusalem at the 
 <I>feasts,</I> and frequented the synagogues on the sabbath day, but 
 his constant residence was in some of those scattered houses that were 
 in the wilderness of Zuph or Maon, which we read of in the story of
 David. There he spent most of his time, in contemplation and devotion, 
 and had not his education in the schools, or at the feet of the rabbin. 
 Note, Many a one is qualified for great usefulness, who yet is buried 
 alive; and many are so long buried who are designed, and are thereby in 
 the fitting, for so much greater usefulness at last; as John Baptist, 
 who was <I>in the desert</I> only <I>till the day of his showing to 
 Israel,</I> when he was in the thirtieth year of his age. Note, There 
 is a time fixed for the <I>showing</I> of those favours to Israel which 
 are reserved; <I>the vision</I> of them <I>is for an appointed time, 
 and at the end it shall speak, and shall not lie.</I></P>
