 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of
 the Jews:
 &nbsp; 2  The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we
 know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do
 these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
 &nbsp; 3  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
 thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
 God.
 &nbsp; 4  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is
 old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be
 born?
 &nbsp; 5  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
 be born of water and <I>of</I> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
 kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 6  That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is
 born of the Spirit is spirit.
 &nbsp; 7  Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
 &nbsp; 8  The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
 thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it
 goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
 &nbsp; 9  Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things
 be?
 &nbsp; 10  Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of
 Israel, and knowest not these things?
 &nbsp; 11  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know,
 and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
 &nbsp; 12  If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how
 shall ye believe, if I tell you <I>of</I> heavenly things?
 &nbsp; 13  And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down
 from heaven, <I>even</I> the Son of man which is in heaven.
 &nbsp; 14  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
 so must the Son of man be lifted up:
 &nbsp; 15  That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
 eternal life.
 &nbsp; 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
 Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
 everlasting life.
 &nbsp; 17  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the
 world; but that the world through him might be saved.
 &nbsp; 18  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that
 believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed
 in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
 &nbsp; 19  And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the
 world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their
 deeds were evil.
 &nbsp; 20  For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither
 cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
 &nbsp; 21  But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds
 may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We found, in the close of the foregoing chapter, that few were brought 
 to Christ at Jerusalem; yet here was <I>one,</I> a considerable one. It 
 is worth while to go a great way for the salvation though but of <I>one 
 soul.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who this Nicodemus was. Not many mighty and noble are called; yet 
 some are, and here was one. <I>Not many</I> of the <I>rulers, or of the 
 Pharisees;</I> yet. 

 1. This was a <I>man of the Pharisees,</I> bred to learning, a scholar.
 Let it not be said that all Christ's followers are <I>unlearned and 
 ignorant men.</I> The principles of the Pharisees, and the 
 peculiarities of their sect, were directly contrary to the spirit of 
 Christianity; yet there were some in whom even those high thoughts were 
 cast down and brought into obedience to Christ. The grace of Christ is 
 able to subdue the greatest opposition. 

 2. He was a <I>ruler of the Jews,</I> a member of the great sanhedrim, 
 a senator, a privy-counsellor, a man of authority in Jerusalem. Bad as 
 things were, there were some rulers <I>well inclined,</I> who yet could 
 do little good because the stream was so strong against them; they were 
 over-ruled by the majority, and yoked with those that were corrupt, so 
 that the good which they wished to do they could not do; yet Nicodemus 
 continued in his place, and did what he <I>could,</I> when he could not 
 do what he <I>would.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His solemn address to our Lord Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When he came: <I>He came to Jesus by night.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) He made a private and particular address to Christ, and did not 
 think it enough to hear his public discourses. He resolved to talk with 
 him by himself, where he might be free with him. Personal converse
 with skilful faithful ministers about the affairs of our souls would be 
 of great use to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>.

 (2.) He made this address <I>by night,</I> which may be considered,

 [1.] As an act of <I>prudence</I> and <I>discretion.</I> Christ was 
 engaged all day in <I>public</I> work, and he would not interrupt him 
 then, nor expect his attendance then, but observed <I>Christ's 
 hour,</I> and waited on him when he was <I>at leisure.</I> Note, 
 Private advantages to ourselves and our own families must give way to 
 those that are public. The greater good must be preferred before the 
 less. Christ had many enemies, and therefore Nicodemus came to him 
 <I>incognito,</I> lest being known to the chief priests they should be 
 the more enraged against Christ.

 [2.] As an act of <I>zeal</I> and <I>forwardness.</I> Nicodemus was a 
 man of business, and could not spare time all day to make Christ a 
 visit, and therefore he would rather take time from the diversions of 
 the <I>evening,</I> or the rest of the <I>night,</I> than not converse 
 with Christ. When others were sleeping, he was getting knowledge, as 
 David by meditation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:6,119:148">Ps. lxiii. 6, and cxix. 148</A>.

 Probably it was the very next night after he saw Christ's miracles, and
 he would not neglect the first opportunity of pursuing his convictions. 
 He knew not how soon Christ might leave the town, nor what might happen 
 betwixt that and another feast, and therefore would lose no time. In 
 the night his converse with Christ would be more free, and less liable 
 to disturbance. These were <I>Noctes Christian&aelig;--Christian
 nights,</I> much more instructive than the <I>Noctes 
 Attic&aelig;--Attic nights.</I> Or,

 [3.] As an act of <I>fear</I> and <I>cowardice.</I> He was afraid, or 
 ashamed, to be <I>seen</I> with Christ, and therefore came <I>in the 
 night.</I> When religion is out <I>of fashion,</I> there are many 
 Nicodemites, especially among the rulers, who have a better affection 
 to Christ and his religion than they would be known to have. But 
 observe, <I>First,</I> Though he came by night, Christ bade him 
 welcome, accepted his integrity, and pardoned his infirmity; he 
 considered his <I>temper,</I> which perhaps was <I>timorous,</I> and 
 the <I>temptation</I> he was in from his place and office; and hereby 
 taught his ministers to become all things to all men, and to encourage 
 good beginnings, though weak. <I>Paul preached privately to those of 
 reputation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:2">Gal. ii. 2</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Though now he came <I>by night,</I> yet afterwards,
 when there was occasion, he owned Christ <I>publicly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:50,19:39"><I>ch.</I> vii. 50; xix. 39</A>.

 The grace which is at first but a grain of mustard-seed may grow to be
 a great tree.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he said. He did not come to talk with Christ about politics and 
 state-affairs (though he was a ruler), but about the concerns of his 
 own soul and its salvation, and, without circumlocution, comes 
 immediately to the business; he calls Christ <I>Rabbi,</I> which 
 signifies a <I>great man;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:20">Isa. xix. 20</A>.

 <I>He shall send them a Saviour, and a great one;</I> a <I>Saviour and 
 a rabbi,</I> so the word is. There are hopes of those who have a 
 respect for Christ, and think and speak honourably of him. He tells 
 Christ how far <I>he had attained:</I> We <I>know that thou art a 
 teacher.</I> Observe,

 (1.) His <I>assertion</I> concerning Christ: <I>Thou art a teacher come 
 from God;</I> not educated nor ordained by men, as other teachers, but 
 supported with divine inspiration and divine authority. He that was to 
 be the sovereign Ruler came first to be a <I>teacher;</I> for he would 
 rule with reason, not with rigour, by the power of truth, not of the 
 sword. The world lay in ignorance and mistake; the Jewish teachers were 
 corrupt, and caused them to err: <I>It is time for the Lord to 
 work.</I> He came a <I>teacher from God,</I> from God as the <I>Father 
 of mercies,</I> in pity to a dark deceived world; from God as the 
 <I>Father of lights</I> and <I>fountain of truth,</I> all the light and 
 truth upon which we may venture our souls. 

 (2.) His <I>assurance</I> of it: <I>We know,</I> not only <I>I,</I> but 
 <I>others;</I> so he took it for granted, the thing being so plain and 
 self-evident. Perhaps he knew that there were divers of the Pharisees 
 and rulers with whom he conversed that were under the same convictions, 
 but had not the grace to own it. Or, we may suppose that he speaks in 
 the plural number (<I>We know</I>) because he brought with him one or 
 more of his friends and pupils, to receive instructions from Christ, 
 knowing them to be of common concern. "Master," saith he, "we come with 
 a desire to be taught, to be thy scholars, for we are fully satisfied 
 thou art a divine teacher." 

 (3.) The ground of this assurance: <I>No man can do those miracles that 
 thou doest, except God be with him.</I> Here,

 [1.] We are assured of the truth of Christ's miracles, and that they 
 were not counterfeit. Here was Nicodemus, a judicious, sensible, 
 inquisitive man, one that had all the <I>reason</I> and 
 <I>opportunity</I> imaginable to examine them, so fully satisfied that 
 they were real miracles that he was wrought upon by them to go contrary 
 to his interest, and to the stream of those of his own rank, who were 
 prejudiced against Christ. 

 [2.] We are directed what inference to draw from Christ's miracles: 
 Therefore we are to receive him as a <I>teacher come from God.</I> His 
 miracles were his credentials. The course of nature could not be 
 altered but by the power of the God of nature, who, we are sure, is the 
 God of truth and goodness, and would never set his seal to a lie or a 
 cheat.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The discourse between Christ and Nicodemus hereupon, or, rather, 
 the sermon Christ preached to him; the contents of it, and that perhaps 
 an abstract of Christ's public preaching; see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Four things our Saviour here discourses of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning the <I>necessity and nature of regeneration</I> or the 
 <I>new birth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:3-8"><I>v.</I> 3-8</A>.
 
 Now we must consider this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As <I>pertinently answered</I> to Nicodemus's address. Jesus 
 <I>answered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 This answer was wither,

 [1.] A <I>rebuke</I> of what he saw <I>defective</I> in the address of 
 Nicodemus. It was not enough for him to admire Christ's miracles, and 
 acknowledge his mission, but he must be <I>born again.</I> It is plain 
 that he expected the <I>kingdom of heaven,</I> the kingdom of the 
 Messiah now shortly to appear. He is betimes aware of the dawning of 
 that day; and, according to the common notion of the Jews, he expects 
 it to appear in external pomp and power. He doubts not but this Jesus, 
 who works these miracles, is either the Messiah or his prophet, and 
 therefore makes his court to him, compliments him, and so hopes to 
 secure a share to himself of the advantages of that kingdom. But Christ 
 tells him that he can have no benefit by that <I>change of the 
 state,</I> unless there be a <I>change of the spirit,</I> of the 
 principles and dispositions, equivalent to a new birth. Nicodemus came 
 <I>by night:</I> "But this will not do," saith Christ. His religion 
 must be owned before men; so Dr. Hammond. Or,

 [2.] A <I>reply</I> to what he saw <I>designed</I> in his address.
 When Nicodemus owned Christ a <I>teacher come from God,</I> one 
 entrusted with an extraordinary revelation from heaven, he plainly 
 intimated a desire to know what this revelation was and a readiness to 
 receive it; and Christ declares it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) As <I>positively</I> and <I>vehemently</I> asserted by our Lord 
 Jesus: <I>Verily, verily, I say unto thee. I the Amen, the Amen, say 
 it;</I> so it may be read: "I the faithful and true witness." The 
 matter is settled irreversibly that <I>except a man be born again he 
 cannot see the kingdom of God.</I> "I say it to <I>thee,</I> though a 
 Pharisee, though a master in Israel." Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What it is that is required: to be <I>born again;</I> that is, 
 <I>First,</I> We must <I>live a new life.</I> Birth is the beginning of 
 life; to be <I>born again</I> is to begin anew, as those that have 
 hitherto lived either much amiss or to little purpose. We must not 
 think to patch up the old building, but begin from the foundation. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> We must <I>have a new nature,</I> new principles, new 
 affections, new aims. We must be born <B><I>anothen</I></B>, which 
 signifies both <I>denuo--again,</I> and <I>desuper--from above.</I> 

 1. We must be born <I>anew;</I> so the word is taken, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9">Gal. iv. 9</A>,

 and <I>ab initio--from the beginning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:3">Luke i. 3</A>.

 By our <I>first birth</I> we are corrupt, shapen in sin and iniquity;
 we must therefore undergo a second birth; our souls must be
 <I>fashioned</I> and <I>enlivened</I> anew. 

 2. We must be born <I>from above,</I> so the word is used by the 
 evangelist,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:31,19:11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 31; xix. 11</A>,

 and I take this to be especially intended here, not excluding the
 other; for to be born <I>from above</I> supposes being <I>born 
 again.</I> But this new birth has its rise <I>from</I> heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:13"><I>ch.</I> i. 13</A>)

 and its tendency <I>to</I> heaven: it is to be born to a <I>divine</I>
 and <I>heavenly</I> life, a life of communion with God and the upper 
 world, and, in order to this, it is to partake of a <I>divine 
 nature</I> and bear the <I>image of the heavenly.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The indispensable necessity of this: "Except <I>a man</I> (Any one 
 that partakes of the human nature, and consequently of its corruptions) 
 <I>be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God,</I> the kingdom of 
 the Messiah begun in <I>grace</I> and perfected in <I>glory.</I>" 
 Except we be <I>born from above,</I> we cannot <I>see</I> this. That 
 is, <I>First,</I> We cannot <I>understand</I> the <I>nature</I> of it. 
 Such is the nature of things pertaining to the kingdom of God (in which 
 Nicodemus desired to be instructed) that the soul must be re-modelled 
 and moulded, the natural man must become a spiritual man, before he is 
 capable of receiving and understanding them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:14">1 Cor. ii. 14</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> We cannot <I>receive the comfort</I> of it, cannot
 expect any benefit by Christ and his gospel, nor have any part or lot 
 in the matter. Note, Regeneration is absolutely necessary to our 
 happiness here and hereafter. Considering what we are by nature, how 
 corrupt and sinful,--what <I>God</I> is, in whom alone we can be
 happy,--and <I>what heaven</I> is, to which the perfection of our
 happiness is reserved,--it will appear, in the nature of the thing, that
 we must be <I>born again,</I> because it is impossible that we should 
 be <I>happy</I> if we be not <I>holy;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11,12">1 Cor. vi. 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This great truth of the necessity of regeneration being thus solemnly 
 laid down,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> It is objected against by Nicodemus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>How can a man be born when he is old,</I> old as I am: <B><I>geron 
 on</I></B>--<I>being an old man? Can he enter the second time into his 
 mother's womb, and be born?</I> Herein appears, 

 (<I>a.</I>) His weakness in knowledge; what Christ spoke spiritually he 
 seems to have understood after a corporal and carnal manner, as if 
 there were no other way of regenerating and new-moulding an immortal 
 soul than by new-framing the body, and bringing that back to the 
 <I>rock out of which it was hewn,</I> as if there was such a connection 
 between the soul and the body that there could be no fashioning the 
 <I>heart anew</I> but by forming the <I>bones anew.</I> Nicodemus, as 
 others of the Jews, valued himself, no doubt, very much on his <I>first 
 birth</I> and its dignities and privileges,--the <I>place</I> of it, 
 the Holy Land, perhaps the holy city,--his <I>parentage,</I> such as 
 that which Paul could have gloried in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:5">Phil. iii. 5</A>.

 And therefore it is a great surprise to him to hear of being <I>born
 again.</I> Could he be better bred and born than bred and born an 
 Israelite, or by any other birth stand fairer for a place in the 
 kingdom of the Messiah? Indeed they looked upon a proselyted Gentile to 
 be as one <I>born again</I> or <I>born anew,</I> but could not imagine 
 how a Jew, a Pharisee, could ever <I>better himself</I> by being 
 <I>born again;</I> he therefore thinks, if he must be <I>born 
 again,</I> it must be of <I>her</I> that <I>bore him first.</I> They 
 that are proud of their <I>first birth</I> are hardly brought to a 
 <I>new birth.</I>

 (<I>b.</I>) His willingness to be taught. He does not turn his back 
 upon Christ because of his hard saying, but ingenuously acknowledges 
 his ignorance, which implies a desire to be better informed; and so I 
 take this, rather than that he had such gross notions of the new birth 
 Christ spoke of: "Lord, make me to understand this, for it is a riddle 
 to me; I am such a fool as to know no other way for a man to be born 
 than of his mother." When we meet with that in the things of God which 
 is <I>dark,</I> and <I>hard to be understood,</I> we must with humility 
 and industry continue our attendance upon the means of knowledge, till 
 God <I>shall reveal even that unto us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> It is opened and further explained by our Lord Jesus,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:5-8"><I>v.</I> 5-8</A>.

 From the objection he takes occasion,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) To repeat and confirm what he had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Verily, verily, I say unto thee,</I> the very same that I said 
 before." Note, The word of God is not yea and nay, but yea and amen; 
 what he hath said he will abide by, whoever saith against it; nor will 
 he retract any of his sayings for the ignorance and mistakes of men. 
 Though Nicodemus understood not the mystery of regeneration, yet Christ 
 asserts the necessity of it as positively as before. Note, It is folly 
 to think of evading the obligation of evangelical precepts, by pleading 
 that they are unintelligible, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:3,4">Rom. iii. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) To expound and clear what he had said concerning 
 regeneration; for the explication of which he further shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>a.</I>] The <I>author</I> of this blessed change, and who it is 
 that works it. To be born again is to be <I>born of the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:5-8"><I>v.</I> 5-8</A>.

 The change is not wrought by any wisdom or power of our own, but by the
 power and influence of the blessed Spirit of grace. It is the 
 <I>sanctification of the Spirit</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:2">1 Pet. i. 2</A>)

 and <I>renewing of the Holy Ghost,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:5">Tit. iii. 5</A>.

 The word he works by is his inspiration, and the heart to be wrought on
 he has access to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>b.</I>] The <I>nature</I> of this change, and what that is which is 
 wrought; it is <I>spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Those that are regenerated are made <I>spiritual,</I> and refined from 
 the dross and dregs of sensuality. The dictates and interests of the
 rational and immortal soul have retrieved the dominion they ought to 
 have over the flesh. The Pharisees placed their religion in external 
 purity and external performances; and it would be a mighty change 
 indeed with them, no less than a new birth, to become 
 <I>spiritual.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>c.</I>] The <I>necessity</I> of this change. <I>First,</I> Christ 
 here shows that it is necessary in the <I>nature of the thing,</I> for 
 we are not fit to enter into the kingdom of God till we are born again: 
 <I>That which is born of the flesh if flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Here is our malady, with the causes of it, which are such that it is 
 plain there is no remedy but we must be <I>born again.</I> 

 1. We are here told <I>what we are:</I> We are <I>flesh,</I> not only
 <I>corporeal</I> but <I>corrupt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:3">Gen. vi. 3</A>.

 The soul is still a spiritual substance, but so wedded to the flesh, so
 captivated by the will of the flesh, so in love with the delights of 
 the flesh, so employed in making provision for the flesh, that it is 
 mostly called <I>flesh;</I> it is carnal. And what communion can there 
 be between God, who is a <I>spirit,</I> and a soul in this condition? 
 
 2. How we <I>came to be so;</I> by being <I>born of the flesh.</I> It
 is a corruption that is bred <I>in the bone</I> with us, and therefore 
 we cannot have a new nature, but we must be <I>born again.</I> The 
 corrupt nature, which is <I>flesh,</I> takes rise from our <I>first 
 birth;</I> and therefore the new nature, which is <I>spirit,</I> must 
 take rise from a second birth. Nicodemus spoke of entering again into 
 his mother's womb, and being born; but, if he could do so, to what 
 purpose? If he were born of his mother a hundred times, that would not
 mend the matter, for still that <I>which is born of the flesh if 
 flesh;</I> a clean thing cannot be brought out of an unclean. He must 
 seek for another original, must be born of the Spirit, or he cannot 
 become spiritual. The case is, in short, this: though man is made to 
 consist of body and soul, yet his spiritual part had then so much the 
 dominion over his corporeal part that he was denominated a <I>living 
 soul</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:7">Gen. ii. 7</A>),

 but by indulging the appetite of the flesh, in eating forbidden fruit, 
 he prostituted the just dominion of the soul to the tyranny of sensual 
 lust, and became no longer a <I>living soul,</I> but flesh: <I>Dust 
 thou art.</I> The living soul became dead and inactive; thus in <I>the 
 day</I> he sinned he <I>surely died,</I> and so he became 
 <I>earthly.</I> In this degenerate state, he begat a son <I>in his own 
 likeness;</I> he transmitted the human nature, which had been entirely 
 deposited in his hands, thus corrupted and depraved; and in the same 
 plight it is still propagated. Corruption and sin are woven into our 
 nature; we are <I>shapen in iniquity,</I> which makes it necessary that 
 the nature be changed. It is not enough to put on a new coat or a new 
 face, but we must put on the <I>new man,</I> we must be new creatures.
 <I>Secondly,</I> Christ makes it further necessary, by his own word: 
 <I>Marvel not that I said unto thee, You must be born again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 1. Christ hath said it, and as he himself never did, nor ever will, 
 unsay it, so all the world cannot gainsay it, that we <I>must be 
 born</I> again. He who is the great <I>Lawgiver,</I> whose will is a 
 law,--he who is the great Mediator of the new covenant, and has full 
 power to settle the terms of our reconciliation to God and happiness in 
 him,--he who is the great Physician of souls, knows their case, and 
 what is necessary to their cure,--he hath said, <I>You must be born 
 again.</I> "I said unto <I>thee</I> that which all are concerned in, 
 You must, you all, one as well as another, <I>you must be born 
 again:</I> not only the common people, but the rulers, the <I>masters 
 in Israel.</I>" 

 2. We are not to <I>marvel</I> at it; for when we consider the holiness
 of the God with whom we have to do, the great design of our redemption, 
 the depravity of our nature, and the constitution of the happiness set 
 before us, we shall not think it strange that so much stress is laid 
 upon this as the one thing needful, that <I>we must be born 
 again.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>d.</I>] This change is illustrated by two comparisons. 
 <I>First,</I> The regenerating work of the Spirit is compared to 
 <I>water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 To be born again is to be <I>born of water</I> and of the Spirit, that 
 is, of the Spirit working like water, as

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:11">Matt. iii. 11</A>)
 
 <I>with the Holy Ghost and with fire</I> means with the Holy Ghost 
 <I>as</I> with fire. 

 1. That which is primarily intended here is to show that the Spirit, in 
 sanctifying a soul,

 (1.) <I>Cleanses</I> and purifies it as water, takes away its filth, by
 which it was unfit for the kingdom of God. It is the <I>washing of
 regeneration,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:5">Tit. iii. 5</A>.
 
 <I>You are washed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>.

 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:25">Ezek. xxxvi. 25</A>.

 (2.) Cools and refreshes it, as water does the hunted hart and the
 weary traveller. The Spirit is compared to water,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38,39,Isa+44:3"><I>ch.</I> vii. 38, 39; Isa. xliv. 3</A>.

 In the first creation, the fruits of heaven were <I>born of water</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:20">Gen. i. 20</A>),

 in allusion to which, perhaps, they that are born from above are said
 to be born of water.

 2. It is probable that Christ had an eye to the ordinance of baptism, 
 which John had used and he himself had begun to use, "You must be born 
 again of the Spirit," which regeneration by the Spirit should be 
 signified by washing with water, as the visible sign of that spiritual 
 grace: not that all they, and they only, that are baptized, are saved; 
 but without that new birth which is wrought by the Spirit, and 
 signified by baptism, none shall be looked upon as the <I>protected 
 privileged</I> subjects of the <I>kingdom of heaven.</I> The Jews 
 cannot partake of the benefits of the Messiah's kingdom, they have so 
 long looked for, unless they quit all expectations of being justified 
 by the works of the law, and submit to the <I>baptism of 
 repentance,</I> the great gospel duty, <I>for the remission of 
 sins,</I> the great gospel privilege. <I>Secondly,</I> It is compared 
 to <I>wind: The wind bloweth where it listeth, so is every one that is 
 born of the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The same word (<B><I>pneuma</I></B>) signifies both the wind and the 
 Spirit. The Spirit came upon the apostles in a <I>rushing mighty 
 wind</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:2">Acts ii. 2</A>),

 his <I>strong</I> influences on the hearts of sinners are compared to 
 the <I>breathing of the wind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:9">Ezek. xxxvii. 9</A>),

 and his <I>sweet</I> influences on the souls of saints to the north and
 south wind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:16">Cant. iv. 16</A>.

 This comparison is here used to show, 

 1. That the Spirit, in regeneration, works <I>arbitrarily,</I> and as a
 free agent. The <I>wind bloweth where it listeth</I> for us, and does
 not attend our order, nor is subject to our command. God <I>directs</I> 
 it; it <I>fulfils his word,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:8">Ps. cxlviii. 8</A>.

 The Spirit dispenses his influences where, and when, on whom, and in
 what measure and degree, he pleases, <I>dividing to every man severally
 as he will,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:11">1 Cor. xii. 11</A>.

 2. That he works <I>powerfully,</I> and with evident effects: <I>Thou 
 hearest the sound thereof;</I> though its causes are hidden, its 
 effects are manifest. When the soul is brought to mourn for sin, to
 groan under the burden of corruption, to breathe after Christ, to cry 
 <I>Abba--Father,</I> then we <I>hear the sound of the Spirit,</I> we 
 find he is at work, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:11">Acts ix. 11</A>,

 <I>Behold he prayeth.</I>

 3. That he works <I>mysteriously,</I> and in secret hidden ways:
 <I>Thou canst not tell whence it comes, nor whither it goes.</I> How it 
 gathers and how it spends its strength is a riddle to us; so the manner 
 and methods of the Spirit's working are a mystery. <I>Which way went 
 the Spirit?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:24">1 Kings xxii. 24</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:5">Eccl. xi. 5</A>,
 
 and compare it with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:14">Ps. cxxxix. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is a discourse concerning the <I>certainty and sublimity of
 gospel truths,</I> which Christ takes occasion for from the weakness of 
 Nicodemus. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The objection which Nicodemus still made 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>How can these things be?</I> Christ's explication of the doctrine of 
 the necessity of regeneration, it should seem, made it never the 
 clearer to him. The corruption of nature which makes it 
 <I>necessary,</I> and the way of the Spirit which makes it 
 <I>practicable,</I> are as much mysteries to him as the thing itself; 
 though he had in general owned Christ a divine teacher, yet he was 
 unwilling to receive his teachings when they did not agree with the 
 notions he had imbibed. Thus many profess to admit the doctrine of 
 Christ in general, and yet will neither believe the truths of 
 Christianity nor submit to the laws of it further than <I>they 
 please.</I> Christ shall be their teacher, provided they may choose 
 their lesson. Now here,

 [1.] Nicodemus owns himself ignorant of Christ's meaning, after all: 
 "<I>How can these things be?</I> They are things I do not understand, 
 my capacity will not reach them." Thus the <I>things of the Spirit of 
 God are foolishness to the natural man.</I> He is not only estranged 
 from them, and therefore they are dark to him, but prejudiced against 
 them, and therefore they are foolishness to him.

 [2.] Because this doctrine was <I>unintelligible</I> to him (so he was 
 pleased to make it), he questions the truth of it; as if, because it 
 was a <I>paradox</I> to him, it was a <I>chimera</I> in itself. Many 
 have such an opinion of their own capacity as to think that that cannot 
 be <I>proved</I> which they cannot <I>believe;</I> by <I>wisdom</I> 
 they <I>knew not</I> Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The reproof which Christ gave him for his dulness and ignorance: 
 "<I>Art thou a master in Israel,</I> <B><I>Didaskalos</I></B>--<I>a
 teacher,</I> a tutor, one who sits in Moses's chair, and yet not only 
 unacquainted with the doctrine of regeneration, but incapable of 
 understanding it?" This word is a reproof, 

 [1.] To those who undertake to teach others and yet are ignorant and 
 unskilful in the word of righteousness themselves. 

 [2.] To those that spend their time in learning and teaching notions 
 and ceremonies in religion, niceties and criticisms in the scripture, 
 and neglect that which is practical and tends to reform the heart and 
 life. Two words in the reproof are very emphatic:--<I>First,</I> The 
 place where his lot was cast: in <I>Israel,</I> where there was such 
 great plenty of the means of knowledge, where divine revelation was. He 
 might have learned this out of the Old Testament. <I>Secondly,</I> The 
 things he was thus ignorant in: <I>these</I> things, these 
 <I>necessary</I> things, there <I>great</I> things, these <I>divine</I> 
 things; had he never read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:5,10,Eze+18:31,36:25,26">Ps. l. 5, 10;
 Ezek. xviii. 31; xxxvi. 25, 26</A>?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Christ's discourse, hereupon, of the certainty and sublimity of 
 gospel truths 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:11-13"><I>v.</I> 11-13</A>),

 to show the folly of those who make strange of these things, and to 
 recommend them to our search. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That the truths Christ taught were very <I>certain</I> and what we 
 may venture upon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>We speak that we do know. We;</I> whom does he mean besides himself? 
 Some understand it of those that bore witness to him and with him on 
 earth, the prophets and John Baptist; they <I>spoke</I> what they 
 <I>knew,</I> and had seen, and were themselves abundantly satisfied in: 
 divine revelation carries its own proof along with it. Others of those 
 that bore witness from heaven, the Father and the Holy Ghost; the 
 Father was with him, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him; therefore he 
 speaks in the plural number, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:23"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 23</A>:

 <I>We will come unto him.</I> Observe, <I>First,</I> That the truths of
 Christ are of undoubted certainty. We have all the reason in the world
 to be assured that the sayings of Christ are <I>faithful sayings,</I>
 and such as we may venture our souls upon; for he is not only a
 <I>credible</I> witness, who would not go about to deceive us, but a
 <I>competent</I> witness, who could not himself be deceived: <I>We
 testify that we have seen.</I> He spoke not upon hear-say, but upon the
 clearest evidence, and therefore with the greatest assurance. What he
 spoke of God, of the invisible world, of heaven and hell, of the divine
 will concerning us, and the counsels of peace, was what he <I>knew,</I>
 and <I>had seen,</I> for he was <I>by him as one brought up with
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>.

 Whatever Christ spoke, he spoke <I>of his own knowledge. Secondly,</I>
 That the unbelief of sinners is greatly aggravated by the infallible 
 certainty of the truths of Christ. The things are thus sure, thus 
 clear; and yet <I>you receive not our witness.</I> Multitudes to be 
 <I>unbelievers</I> of that which yet (so cogent are the motives of 
 credibility) they cannot <I>disbelieve!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The truths Christ taught, though communicated in language and 
 expressions borrowed from common and earthly things, yet in their own 
 nature were most sublime and heavenly; this is intimated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>:

 "<I>If I have told them earthly things,</I> that is, have told them the 
 great things of God in similitudes taken from earthly things, to make 
 them the more easy and intelligible, as that of the <I>new birth</I> 
 and the <I>wind,--</I> if I have thus accommodated myself to your 
 capacities, and lisped to you in your own language, and cannot make you 
 to understand my doctrine,--<I>what would you do</I> if I should 
 accommodate myself to the nature of the things, and speak with the 
 tongue of angels, that language which mortals cannot utter? If such 
 <I>familiar expressions</I> be stumbling-blocks, what would <I>abstract 
 ideas</I> be, and spiritual things painted <I>proper?</I>" Now we may 
 learn hence, <I>First,</I> To admire the height and depth of the 
 doctrine of Christ; it is a great mystery of godliness. The things of 
 the gospel are <I>heavenly</I> things, out of the road of the enquiries 
 of human reason, and much more out of the reach of its discoveries.
 <I>Secondly,</I> To acknowledge with thankfulness the condescension of 
 Christ, that he is pleased to suit the manner of the gospel revelation 
 to our capacities, <I>to speak to us as to children.</I> He considers 
 our <I>frame,</I> that we are <I>of</I> the earth, and our 
 <I>place,</I> that we are <I>on</I> the earth, and therefore speaks to 
 us earthly things, and makes things sensible the vehicle of things 
 spiritual, to make them the more easy and familiar to us. Thus he has 
 done both in parables and in sacraments. <I>Thirdly,</I> To lament the 
 corruption of our nature, and our great unaptness to receive and 
 entertain the truths of Christ. Earthly things are despised because 
 they are <I>vulgar,</I> and heavenly things because they are 
 <I>abstruse;</I> and so, whatever method is taken, still some fault or 
 other is found with it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:17">Matt. xi. 17</A>),

 but Wisdom is, and will be, <I>justified of her children,</I> 
 notwithstanding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Our Lord Jesus, and he alone, was fit to reveal to us a doctrine 
 thus certain, thus sublime: <I>No man hath ascended up into heaven but 
 he,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> None but Christ was able to reveal to us the will of God 
 for our salvation. Nicodemus addressed Christ as a prophet; but he must 
 know that he is greater than all the Old-Testament prophets, for none 
 of them <I>had ascended into heaven.</I> They wrote by divine 
 inspiration, and not of their own knowledge; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>.

 Moses ascended into the mount, but not into heaven. No man hath
 attained to the certain knowledge of God and heavenly things as Christ
 has; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>.

 It is not for us to send to heaven for instructions; we must wait to
 receive what instructions Heaven will send to us; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:4,De+30:12">Prov. xxx. 4; Deut. xxx. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Jesus Christ is able, and fit, and every way 
 qualified, to reveal the will of God to us; for it is <I>he that came 
 down from heaven</I> and <I>is in heaven.</I> He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 <I>How shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</I> Now 
 here, 

 1. He gives them an instance of those <I>heavenly things</I> which he
 could tell them of, when he tells them of one that <I>came down from 
 heaven,</I> and yet is the <I>Son of man;</I> is the <I>Son of man,</I> 
 and yet is <I>in heaven.</I> If the regeneration of the <I>soul of 
 man</I> is such a mystery, what then is the incarnation of the <I>Son 
 of God?</I> These are divine and heavenly things indeed. We have here 
 an intimation of Christ's two distinct natures in one person: his 
 divine nature, in which he <I>came down from heaven;</I> his human 
 nature, in which he is the <I>Son of man;</I> and that union of those 
 two, in that while he is the Son of man yet he is <I>in heaven.</I> 

 2. He gives them a proof of his ability to speak to them <I>heavenly
 things,</I> and to lead them into the arcana of the kingdom of heaven, 
 by telling them,

 (1.) That <I>he came down from heaven.</I> The intercourse settled 
 between God and man began <I>above;</I> the first motion towards it did 
 not arise from this earth, but <I>came down from heaven.</I> We love 
 him, and send to him, because he first loved us, and sent to us. Now 
 this intimates,

 [1.] Christ's divine nature. He that came down from heaven is certainly 
 more than a mere man; he is the <I>Lord from heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:47">1 Cor. xv. 47</A>.
 
 [2.] His intimate acquaintance with the divine counsels; for, coming 
 from the court of heaven, he had been from eternity conversant with 
 them. 

 [3.] The <I>manifestation of God.</I> Under the Old Testament God's 
 favours to his people are expressed by his <I>hearing from heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:14">2 Chron. vii. 14</A>),
 
 <I>looking from heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:14">Ps. lxxx. 14</A>),

 <I>speaking from heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:13">Neh. ix. 13</A>),
 
 sending from heaven,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:3">Ps. lvii. 3</A>.
 
 But the New Testament shows us God <I>coming down</I> from heaven, to
 teach and save us. That he thus <I>descended</I> is an admirable 
 <I>mystery,</I> for the Godhead cannot change places, nor did he bring 
 his body from heaven; but that he thus <I>condescended</I> for our 
 redemption is a more admirable <I>mercy;</I> herein he commended his 
 love. 

 (2.) That <I>he is the Son of man, that</I> Son of man spoken of by 
 Daniel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13">vii. 13</A>),

 by which the Jews always understand to be meant the Messiah. Christ,
 in calling himself the <I>Son of man,</I> shows that he is the 
 <I>second Adam,</I> for the first Adam was the <I>father of man.</I> 
 And of all the Old-Testament titles of the Messiah he chose to make use 
 of <I>this,</I> because it was most expressive of his <I>humility,</I> 
 and most agreeable to his present state of <I>humiliation.</I> 

 (3.) That he <I>is in heaven.</I> Now at this time, when he is talking 
 with Nicodemus on earth, yet, as God, he is <I>in heaven.</I> The 
 <I>Son of man,</I> as such, was not in heaven till his ascension; but 
 he that was the Son of man was now, by his divine nature, every where 
 present, and particularly in heaven. Thus the Lord of glory, as such, 
 could not be crucified, nor could God, as such, shed his blood; yet 
 that person who was the Lord of glory was crucified 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>),

 and God purchased the church with <I>his own blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Acts xx. 28</A>.

 So close is the union of the two natures in one person that there is a 
 communication of properties. He doth not say <B><I>hos esti</I></B>.
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT> is the <B><I>ho on to ourano</I></B>--<I>he
 that is,</I> and heaven is the habitation of <I>his holiness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ here discourses of the <I>great design of his own coming into 
 the world, and the happiness of those that believe in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:14-18"><I>v.</I> 14-18</A>.

 Here we have the very marrow and quintessence of the whole gospel, that 
 <I>faithful saying</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:15">1 Tim. i. 15</A>),

 that Jesus Christ came to seek and to save the children of men from 
 death, and recover them to life. Now sinners are <I>dead men</I> upon a 
 twofold account:--

 (1.) As one that is mortally wounded, or sick of an incurable disease, 
 is said to be a <I>dead man,</I> for he is dying; and so Christ came to 
 save us, by <I>healing</I> us, as the brazen serpent healed the 
 Israelites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 (2.) As one that is justly condemned to die for an unpardonable crime
 is a <I>dead man,</I> he is <I>dead in law;</I> and, in reference to 
 this part of our danger, Christ came to save as a prince or judge, 
 publishing an act of indemnity, or general pardon, under certain 
 provisos; this saving here is opposed to condemning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Jesus Christ came to save us by <I>healing</I> us, as the children 
 of Israel that were stung with fiery serpents were cured and 
 <I>lived</I> by looking up to the brazen serpent; we have the story of 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:6-9">Num. xxi. 6-9</A>.

 It was the <I>last</I> miracle that passed through the hand of Moses
 before his death. Now in this type of Christ we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The <I>deadly</I> and <I>destructive</I> nature of 
 <I>sin,</I> which is implied here. The guilt of sin is like the 
 <I>pain</I> of the biting of a fiery serpent; the power of corruption 
 is like the <I>venom</I> diffused thereby. The devil is the old 
 serpent, subtle at first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:1">Gen. iii. 1</A>),

 but ever since <I>fiery,</I> and his temptations <I>fiery darts,</I> 
 his assaults terrifying, his victories destroying. Ask awakened 
 consciences, ask damned sinners, and they will tell you, how charming 
 soever the allurements of sin are, <I>at the last it bites like a 
 serpent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:30-32">Prov. xxiii. 30-32</A>.

 God's wrath against us for sin is as those fiery serpents which God 
 sent among the people, to punish them for their murmurings. The curses 
 of the law are as fiery serpents, so are all the tokens of divine 
 wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The powerful remedy provided against this fatal 
 malady. The case of poor sinners is deplorable; but is it desperate? 
 Thanks be to God, it is not; there is balm in Gilead. The <I>Son of man 
 is lifted up,</I> as the <I>serpent of brass</I> was by Moses, which 
 cured the stung Israelites. 

 1. It was a <I>serpent of brass</I> that cured them. Brass is
 <I>bright;</I> we read of Christ's feet <I>shining like brass,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:15">Rev. i. 15</A>.

 It is <I>durable;</I> Christ is the same. It was made in the shape of a 
 <I>fiery serpent,</I> and yet had no poison, no sting, fitly 
 representing Christ, who was <I>made sin for us</I> and yet knew no 
 sin; was <I>made in the likeness of sinful flesh</I> and yet not 
 sinful; as harmless as a serpent of brass. The serpent was a cursed 
 creature; Christ was made a <I>curse.</I> That which cured them 
 reminded them of their plague; so in Christ sin is set before us most 
 fiery and formidable. 

 2. It was lifted up upon a pole, and so <I>must</I> the Son of man be
 lifted up; thus it <I>behoved him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:26,46">Luke xxiv. 26, 46</A>.

 No remedy now. Christ is lifted up,

 (1.) In his <I>crucifixion.</I> He was lifted up upon the cross. His
 death is called his being <I>lifted up,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:32,33"><I>ch.</I> xii. 32, 33</A>.

 He was lifted up as a spectacle, as a mark, lifted up between heaven
 and earth, as if he had been unworthy of either and abandoned by both. 
 
 (2.) In his <I>exaltation.</I> He was lifted up to the Father's right 
 hand, to give repentance and remission; he was lifted up to the cross, 
 to be further lifted up to the crown. 

 (3.) In the <I>publishing</I> and <I>preaching</I> of his everlasting
 gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6">Rev. xiv. 6</A>.

 The serpent was lifted up that all the thousands of Israel might see 
 it. Christ in the gospel is exhibited to us, evidently set forth; 
 Christ is <I>lifted up</I> as an <I>ensign,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10">Isa. xi. 10</A>.

 3. It was lifted up by Moses. Christ was made under the law of Moses,
 and Moses testified of him. 

 4. Being thus lifted up, it was appointed for the cure of those that
 were bitten by fiery serpents. He that sent the plague provided the 
 remedy. None could redeem and save us but he whose justice had
 condemned us. It was God himself that <I>found the ransom,</I> and the 
 efficacy of it depends upon his appointment. The <I>fiery serpents</I> 
 were sent to punish them for their <I>tempting Christ</I> (so the 
 apostle saith,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:9">1 Cor. x. 9</A>),

 and yet they were healed by virtue derived from him. He whom we have 
 offended is <I>our peace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The way of <I>applying</I> this remedy, and that is by
 <I>believing,</I> which plainly alludes to the Israelites' <I>looking 
 up</I> to the brazen serpent, in order to their being healed by it. If 
 any stung Israelite was either so little sensible of his pain and 
 peril, or had so little confidence in the word of Moses as not to look 
 up to the brazen serpent, justly did he die of his wound; but every one
 that <I>looked up to it</I> did well, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:9">Num. xxi. 9</A>.

 If any so far slight either their disease by sin or the method of cure 
 by Christ as not to embrace Christ upon his own terms, their blood is 
 upon their own head. He hath said, <I>Look, and be saved</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:22">Isa. xlv. 22</A>),

 look and live. We must take a complacency in and give consent to the
 methods which Infinite Wisdom has taken is saving a guilty world, by 
 the mediation of Jesus Christ, as the great sacrifice and 
 intercessor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> The great encouragements given us by faith to look up 
 to him. 

 1. It was for this end that he was <I>lifted up,</I> that his followers 
 might be saved; and he will pursue his end.

 2. The offer that is made of salvation by him is general, that
 <I>whosoever believes</I> in him, without exception, might have benefit
 by him.

 3. The salvation offered is complete.

 (1.) They <I>shall not perish,</I> shall not die of their wounds;
 though they may be pained and ill frightened, iniquity shall not be 
 their ruin. But that is not all. 

 (2.) They shall <I>have eternal life.</I> They shall not only not die 
 of their wounds in the wilderness, but they shall reach Canaan (which 
 they were then just ready to enter into); they shall enjoy the promised 
 rest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Jesus Christ came to save us by <I>pardoning us,</I> that we might 
 not die by the sentence of the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 Here is <I>gospel</I> indeed, good <I>news,</I> the best that ever came 
 from heaven to earth. Here is <I>much,</I> here is <I>all</I> in a
 little, the word of reconciliation in miniature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Here is God's <I>love</I> in <I>giving his Son for the 
 world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 where we have three things:--

 1. The great <I>gospel mystery</I> revealed: <I>God so loved the world 
 that he gave his only-begotten Son.</I> The love of God the Father is 
 the original of our regeneration by the Spirit and our reconciliation 
 by the lifting up of the Son. Note,

 (1.) Jesus Christ is the <I>only-begotten Son of God.</I> This 
 magnifies his love in giving him for us, in giving him to us; now know 
 we that he loves us, when he has given his <I>only-begotten Son for 
 us,</I> which expresses not only his dignity in himself, but his 
 dearness to his Father; he was <I>always his delight.</I> 

 (2.) In order to the redemption and salvation of man, it pleased God to 
 <I>give his only-begotten Son.</I> He not only sent him into the world 
 with full and ample power to negotiate a peace between heaven and 
 earth, but he <I>gave him,</I> that is, he gave him up to suffer and 
 die for us, as the great propitiation or expiatory sacrifice. It comes 
 in here as a reason why he <I>must be lifted up;</I> for so it was 
 determined and designed by the Father, who gave him for this purpose, 
 and <I>prepared him a body</I> in order to it. His enemies could not
 have <I>taken him</I> if his Father had not <I>given</I> him. Though he 
 was not yet crucified, yet in the determinate counsel of God he was 
 <I>given</I> up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.

 Nay, further, God has <I>given him,</I> that is, he has made an offer 
 of him, to all, and given him to all true believers, to all the intents 
 and purposes of the new covenant. He has given him to be our 
 <I>prophet,</I> a <I>witness to the people,</I> the high priest of our 
 profession, to be our peace, to be head of the church and head over all 
 things to the church, to be to us all we need.

 (3.) Herein God has commended his <I>love to the world:</I> God so
 <I>loved the world,</I> so really, so richly. Now his creatures shall 
 see that he loves them, and wishes them well. He so loved the world of 
 fallen man as he did not love that of fallen angels; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:8,1Jo+4:10">Rom. v. 8; 1 John iv. 10</A>.

 Behold, and wonder, that the <I>great God</I> should love such a
 <I>worthless</I> world! That the <I>holy God</I> should love such a 
 <I>wicked</I> world with a love of good will, when he could not look 
 upon it with any complacency. This was a <I>time of love indeed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:6,8">Ezek. xvi. 6, 8</A>.

 The Jews vainly conceited that the Messiah should be sent only in love
 to <I>their nation,</I> and to advance them upon the ruins of their 
 neighbours; but Christ tells them that he came in love to the <I>whole 
 world,</I> Gentiles as well as Jews,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:2">1 John ii. 2</A>.

 Though many of the world of mankind perish, yet God's giving his
 only-begotten Son was an instance of his love to the whole world, 
 because through him there is a <I>general offer</I> of life and 
 salvation made to all. It is love to the revolted rebellious province 
 to issue out a proclamation of pardon and indemnity to all that will 
 come in, plead it upon their knees, and return to their allegiance. So 
 <I>far God loved the</I> apostate lapsed <I>world</I> that he sent his 
 Son with this fair proposal, that <I>whosoever believes in him,</I> one 
 or other, <I>shall not perish. Salvation</I> has been <I>of the
 Jews,</I> but now Christ is <I>known as salvation to the ends of the 
 earth,</I> a <I>common salvation.</I>

 2. Here is the great <I>gospel duty,</I> and that is to <I>believe in
 Jesus Christ</I> (Whom God has thus given, given <I>for us,</I> given
 <I>to us</I>), to accept the gift, and answer the intention of the
 giver. We must yield an unfeigned assent and consent to the record God
 hath given in his word concerning his Son. God having given him to us
 to be our prophet, priest, and king, we must give up ourselves to be
 ruled, and taught, and saved by him. 

 3. Here is the great gospel benefit: <I>That whosoever believes in 
 Christ shall not perish.</I> This he had said before, and here repeats 
 it. It is the unspeakable happiness of all true believers, for which 
 they are eternally indebted to Christ, 

 (1.) That they are saved from the miseries of hell, delivered from 
 <I>going down to the pit;</I> they <I>shall not perish.</I> God has 
 taken away their sin, they shall not die; a pardon is purchased, and so 
 the attainder is reversed. 

 (2.) They are entitled to the joys of heaven: they shall <I>have 
 everlasting life.</I> The convicted traitor is not only pardoned, but 
 preferred, and made a favourite, and treated as one whom the King of 
 kings <I>delights to honour. Out of prison he comes to reign,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:14">Eccl. iv. 14</A>.

 If believers, then children; and, if <I>children, then heirs.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Here is God's design in sending hi Son into the world:
 it was <I>that the world through him might be saved.</I> He came into 
 the world with salvation in <I>his eye,</I> with salvation <I>in his 
 hand.</I> Therefore the aforementioned offer of live and salvation is 
 sincere, and shall be made good to all that by faith accept it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):
 
 <I>God sent his Son into the world,</I> this guilty, rebellious, 
 apostate world; sent him as his agent or ambassador, not as sometimes 
 he had sent angels into the world as visitants, but as resident. Ever 
 since man sinned, he has dreaded the approach and appearance of any 
 special messenger from heaven, as being conscious of guilt and looking 
 for judgment: <I>We shall surely die, for we have seen God.</I> If 
 therefore the Son of God himself come, we are concerned to enquire on 
 what errand he comes: <I>Is it peace?</I> Or, as they asked Samuel 
 trembling, <I>Comest thou peaceably?</I> And this scripture returns the 
 answer, <I>Peaceably.</I> 

 1. He did not come to <I>condemn the world.</I> We had reason enough to
 expect that he should, for it is a guilty world; it is 
 <I>convicted,</I> and what cause can be shown why judgment should not 
 be given, and execution awarded, according to law? That <I>one
 blood</I> of which all <I>nations</I> of men are made

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:26">Acts xvii. 26</A>)

 is not only <I>tainted</I> with an hereditary <I>disease,</I> like 
 Gehazi's leprosy, but it is <I>tainted</I> with an hereditary 
 <I>guilt,</I> like that of the Amalekites, with whom God had war 
 <I>from generation to generation;</I> and justly may such a world as 
 this be <I>condemned;</I> and if God would have sent to condemn it he 
 had angels at command, to pour out the vials of his wrath, a cherub 
 with a flaming sword ready to do execution. <I>If the Lord had been 
 pleased to kill us,</I> he would not have sent his Son amongst us. He 
 came with full powers indeed to <I>execute judgment</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:22,27"><I>ch.</I> v. 22, 27</A>),

 but did not begin with a judgment of condemnation, did not proceed upon
 the outlawry, nor take advantage against us for the breach of the 
 <I>covenant of innocency,</I> but put us upon a new trial before a 
 <I>throne of grace.</I> 

 2. He came <I>that the world through him might be saved,</I> that a
 door of salvation might be opened to the world, and whoever would might 
 enter in by it. God was in Christ <I>reconciling the world to 
 himself,</I> and so <I>saving</I> it. An act of indemnity is passed and 
 published, through Christ a remedial law made, and the world of mankind 
 dealt with, not according to the rigours of the first covenant, but 
 according to the riches of the second; <I>that the world</I> through 
 him might be saved, for it could never be saved but <I>through him; 
 there is not salvation in any other.</I> This is good news to a 
 convinced conscience, healing to broken bones and bleeding wounds, that 
 Christ, our judge, came not to <I>condemn,</I> but to <I>save.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] From all this is inferred the happiness of true believers: <I>He 
 that believeth on him is not condemned,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Though he has been a sinner, a great sinner, and <I>stands 
 convicted</I> (<I>habes confilentem reum--by his own confession</I>), 
 yet, upon his believing, process is stayed, judgment is arrested, and 
 he is <I>not condemned.</I> This denotes more than a reprieve; he <I>is 
 not condemned,</I> that is, he is acquitted; he <I>stand upon his 
 deliverance</I> (as we say), and if he be not condemned he is 
 discharged; <B><I>ou krinetai</I></B>--<I>he is not judged,</I> not 
 dealt with in strict justice, according to the desert of his sins. He 
 is <I>accused,</I> and he cannot plead <I>not guilty</I> to the 
 indictment, but he can plead <I>in bar,</I> can plead a <I>noli 
 prosequi</I> upon the indictment, as blessed Paul does, <I>Who is he 
 that condemns? It is Christ that died.</I> He is <I>afflicted,</I> 
 chastened of God, persecuted by the world; but he is not 
 <I>condemned.</I> The cross perhaps lies heavy upon him, but he is 
 saved from the curse: condemned <I>by the world,</I> it may be, but not 
 <I>condemned with the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:1,1Co+11:32">Rom. viii. 1; 1 Cor. xi. 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ, in the close, discourses concerning the <I>deplorable 
 condition of those that persist in unbelief and wilful ignorance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:18-21"><I>v.</I> 18-21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Read here the doom of those that will not <I>believe in 
 Christ:</I> they <I>are condemned already.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] How great the <I>sin</I> of unbelievers is; it is aggravated from 
 the dignity of the person they slight; they <I>believe not in the name 
 of the only-begotten Son of God,</I> who is infinitely <I>true,</I> and 
 deserves to be believed, <I>infinitely good,</I> and deserves to be 
 embraced. God sent one to save us that was <I>dearest</I> to himself; 
 and shall not he be <I>dearest to us?</I> Shall we not believe on his 
 name who has a name above every name? 

 [2.] How great the <I>misery</I> of unbelievers is: they are 
 <I>condemned already;</I> which bespeaks, <I>First,</I> A 
 <I>certain</I> condemnation. They are as sure to be condemned in the 
 judgment of the great day as if they were condemned already. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> A <I>present</I> condemnation. The curse has already 
 taken hold of them; the wrath of God now fastens upon them. They are
 condemned already, for their own hearts condemn them. <I>Thirdly,</I>
 A condemnation <I>grounded upon their former guilt:</I> He is condemned 
 <I>already,</I> for he lies open to the law for all his sins; the 
 obligation of the law is in full force, power, and virtue, against him, 
 because he is not by faith interested in the gospel defeasance; <I>he 
 is condemned already, because he has not believed.</I> Unbelief may 
 truly be called <I>the great damning sin,</I> because it leaves us 
 under the guilt of all our other sins; it is a sin against the 
 <I>remedy,</I> against our <I>appeal.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Read also the doom of those that would not so much as <I>know 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Many <I>inquisitive</I> people had knowledge of Christ and his doctrine 
 and miracles, but they were prejudiced against him, and would not 
 believe in him, while the generality were sottishly careless and 
 stupid, and would not <I>know</I> him. And <I>this is the 
 condemnation,</I> the sin that ruined them, <I>that light is come into 
 the world, and they loved darkness rather.</I> Now here observe,

 [1.] That the gospel is light, and, when the gospel came, <I>light came 
 into the world,</I> Light is <I>self-evidencing,</I> so is the gospel; 
 it proves its own divine origin. Light is <I>discovering,</I> and 
 <I>truly the light is sweet,</I> and rejoices the heart. It is a light 
 shining in a dark place, and a dark place indeed the world would be 
 without it. It is <I>come into all the world</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:6">Col. i. 6</A>),

 and not confined to one corner of it, as the Old-Testament light was.

 [2.] It is the unspeakable folly of the most of men that they loved 
 darkness rather than light, rather than <I>this</I> light. The Jews 
 loved the dark shadows of their law, and the instructions of their 
 <I>blind guides,</I> rather than the doctrine of Christ. The Gentiles 
 loved their superstitious services of <I>an unknown God,</I> whom they 
 <I>ignorantly worshipped,</I> rather than the <I>reasonable service</I> 
 which the gospel enjoins. Sinners that were wedded to their lusts loved 
 their ignorance and mistakes, which supported them in their sins, 
 rather than the truths of Christ, which would have parted them from 
 their sins. Man's apostasy began in an affectation of forbidden 
 knowledge, but is kept up by an affectation of forbidden ignorance.
 Wretched man is in love with his sickness, in love with his slavery, 
 and will not be made <I>free,</I> will not be <I>made whole.</I> 

 [3.] The true reason why men love darkness rather than light is 
 <I>because their deeds are evil.</I> They love darkness because they 
 think it is an excuse for their evil deeds, and they hate the light 
 because it robs them of the good opinion they had of themselves, by 
 showing them their sinfulness and misery. Their case is sad, and, 
 because they are resolved that they will not <I>mend</I> it, they are 
 resolved that they will not <I>see it.</I> 

 [4.] Wilful ignorance is so far from excusing sin that it will be 
 found, at the great day, to aggravate the condemnation: <I>This is the 
 condemnation,</I> this is what ruins souls, that they shut their eyes 
 against the light, and will not so much as admit a parley with Christ 
 and his gospel; they set God so much at defiance that they desire not 
 the knowledge of his ways, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:14">Job xxi. 14</A>.

 We must account in the judgment, not only for the knowledge we 
 <I>had,</I> and <I>used not,</I> but for the knowledge we <I>might have 
 had,</I> and <I>would not;</I> not only for the knowledge we <I>sinned 
 against,</I> but for the knowledge we <I>sinned away.</I> For the 
 further illustration of this he shows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>)

 that according as men's hearts and lives are good or bad, so they stand
 affected to the light Christ has brought into the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> It is not strange if those that do evil, and resolve to 
 persist in it, hate the light of Christ's gospel; for it is a common 
 observation that <I>every one that doeth evil hateth the light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Evil-doers seek concealment, out of a sense of shame and fear of 
 punishment; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:13">Job xxiv. 13</A>,

 &c. Sinful works are <I>works of darkness;</I> sin from the first
 affected concealment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:33">Job xxxi. 33</A>.
 
 The <I>light shakes</I> the wicked,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:12,13">Job xxxviii. 12, 13</A>.

 Thus the gospel is a terror to the wicked world: <I>They come not to
 this light,</I> but keep as far off it as they can, <I>lest their deeds 
 should be reproved.</I> Note, 

 1. The light of the gospel is sent into the world to <I>reprove the 
 evil deeds</I> of sinners; to make them manifest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:13">Eph. v. 13</A>),

 to <I>show</I> people <I>their transgressions,</I> to show that to be
 sin which was not thought to be so, and to show them the evil of their 
 transgressions, <I>that sin by the</I> new <I>commandment</I> might 
 appear <I>exceeding sinful.</I> The gospel has its convictions, to make 
 way for its consolations. 

 2. It is for this reason that evil-doers <I>hate the light</I> of the
 gospel. There were those who <I>had done evil</I> and were sorry for
 it, who bade this light welcome, as the <I>publicans and harlots.</I> 
 But he that <I>does evil,</I> that does it and resolves to go on in it, 
 <I>hateth the light,</I> cannot bear to be told of his faults. All that 
 opposition which the gospel of Christ has met with in the world comes 
 from the <I>wicked heart,</I> influenced by the <I>wicked one.</I> 
 Christ is hated because sin is loved. 

 3. They who do not <I>come to the light</I> thereby evidence a secret
 <I>hatred</I> of the light. If they had not an antipathy to <I>saving 
 knowledge,</I> they would not sit down so contentedly in <I>damning 
 ignorance.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> On the other hand, upright hearts, that approve
 themselves to God in their integrity, bid this light welcome

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>He that doeth truth cometh to the light.</I> It seems, then, that 
 though the gospel had many enemies it had some friends. It is a common
 observation that <I>truth seeks no corners.</I> Those who mean and act 
 honestly dread not a scrutiny, but desire it rather. Now this is 
 applicable to the gospel light; as it <I>convinces</I> and 
 <I>terrifies</I> evil-doers, so it <I>confirms</I> and <I>comforts</I> 
 those that walk in their integrity. Observe here, 

 1. The character of a <I>good man.</I>

 (1.) He is one that <I>doeth truth;</I> that is, he acts truly and
 sincerely in all he does. Though sometimes he comes short of <I>doing 
 good,</I> the good he would do, yet he <I>doeth truth,</I> he aims 
 honestly; he has his infirmities, but holds fast his integrity; as 
 Gaius, that <I>did faithfully</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:5">3 John 5</A>),

 as Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12">2 Cor. i. 12</A>),

 as Nathanael
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:47"><I>ch.</I> i. 47</A>),
 
 as Asa, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:14">1 Kings xv. 14</A>.

 (2.) He is one that <I>cometh to the light.</I> He is ready to receive
 and entertain divine revelation as far as it appears to him to be so,
 what uneasiness soever it may create him. He that <I>doeth truth</I> is
 willing to know the <I>truth</I> by himself, and to <I>have his deeds
 made manifest.</I> A good man is much employed in trying himself, and
 is desirous that God would try him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:2">Ps. xxvi. 2</A>.

 He is solicitous to <I>know</I> what the will of God is, and resolves
 to <I>do</I> it, though ever so contrary to his own will and interest.
 
 2. Here is the character of a <I>good work:</I> it is <I>wrought in
 God,</I> in union with him by a covenanting faith, and in communion 
 with him by devout affections. Our works are <I>then</I> good, and will 
 bear the test, when the will of God is the rule of them and the glory 
 of God the end of them; when they are done in his strength, and for his 
 sake, to him, and not to men; and if, by the light of the gospel, it be 
 manifest to us that our works are thus wrought, <I>then shall we have 
 rejoicing,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the
 land of Jud&aelig;a; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
 &nbsp; 23  And John also was baptizing in &AElig;non near to Salim, because
 there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
 &nbsp; 24  For John was not yet cast into prison.
 &nbsp; 25  Then there arose a question between <I>some</I> of John's
 disciples and the Jews about purifying.
 &nbsp; 26  And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that
 was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold,
 the same baptizeth, and all <I>men</I> come to him.
 &nbsp; 27  John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it
 be given him from heaven.
 &nbsp; 28  Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the
 Christ, but that I am sent before him.
 &nbsp; 29  He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of
 the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly
 because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is
 fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 30  He must increase, but I <I>must</I> decrease.
 &nbsp; 31  He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the
 earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from
 heaven is above all.
 &nbsp; 32  And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no
 man receiveth his testimony.
 &nbsp; 33  He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal
 that God is true.
 &nbsp; 34  For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God
 giveth not the Spirit by measure <I>unto him.</I>
 &nbsp; 35  The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into
 his hand.
 &nbsp; 36  He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he
 that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of
 God abideth on him.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's removal into the land of Judea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and there he tarried with his disciples. Observe, 

 1. Our Lord Jesus, after he entered upon his public work, travelled 
 much, and removed often, as the patriarchs in their sojournings. As it 
 was a good part of his humiliation that he had no certain 
 dwelling-place, but was, as Paul, <I>in journeyings often,</I> so it 
 was an instance of his unwearied industry, in the work for which he 
 came into the world, that he went about in prosecution of it; many a 
 weary step he took to do good to souls. The <I>Sun of righteousness</I> 
 took a large circuit to diffuse his light and heat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:6">Ps. xix. 6</A>.

 2. He was not wont to stay long at Jerusalem. Though he went frequently
 thither, yet he soon returned into the country; as here. <I>After these 
 things,</I> after he had had this discourse with Nicodemus, he came 
 into the land of Judea; not so much for <I>greater privacy</I> (though 
 mean and obscure places best suited the humble Jesus in his humble 
 state) as for <I>greater usefulness.</I> His preaching and miracles, 
 perhaps, made <I>most noise</I> at Jerusalem, the fountain-head of 
 news, but did <I>least good</I> there, where the most considerable men 
 of the Jewish church had so much the ascendant. 

 3. When he came into the land of Judea his <I>disciples came with
 him;</I> for these were <I>they that continued with him in his 
 temptations.</I> Many that flocked to him at Jerusalem could not follow 
 his motions into the country, they had no business there; but his 
 disciples attended him. If the ark remove, it is better to <I>remove 
 and go after it</I> (as those did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:3">Josh. iii. 3</A>)

 than sit still without it, though it be in Jerusalem itself.

 4. There he <I>tarried with them,</I> <B><I>dietribe</I></B>--<I>He
 conversed</I> with them, <I>discoursed</I> with them. He did not retire 
 into the country for his ease and pleasure, but for more free 
 conversation with his disciples and followers. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:11,12">Cant. vii. 11, 12</A>.
 
 Note, Those that are ready to <I>go with Christ</I> shall find him as
 ready to <I>stay with them.</I> It is supposed that he now staid five 
 or six months in this country. 

 5. There <I>he baptized;</I> he admitted disciples, such as believed in
 him, and had more honesty and courage than those had at Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:42"><I>ch.</I> ii. 24</A>.

 John began to baptize in the land of Judea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:1">Matt. iii. 1</A>),

 therefore Christ began there, for John had said, <I>There comes one 
 after me.</I> He himself <I>baptized</I> not, with his own hand, but 
 his disciples by his orders and directions, as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:2"><I>ch.</I> iv. 2</A>.

 But his disciples' baptizing was his baptizing. Holy ordinances are
 Christ's, though administered by weak men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. John's continuance in his work, as long as his opportunities 
 lasted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.
 
 Here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That <I>John was baptizing.</I> Christ's baptism was, for substance, 
 the same with John's, for John bore witness to Christ, and therefore 
 they did not at all clash or interfere with one another. But, 

 (1.) Christ began the work of preaching and baptizing before <I>John 
 laid it down,</I> that he might be ready to receive John's disciples 
 when he should be taken off, and so the wheels might be kept going. It 
 is a comfort to useful men, when they are going off the stage, to see 
 those rising up who are likely to fill up their place. 

 (2.) John continued the work of preaching and baptizing though Christ 
 had <I>taken it up;</I> for he would still, according to the <I>measure 
 given to him,</I> advance the interests of God's kingdom. There was 
 still work for John to do, for Christ was not yet <I>generally 
 known,</I> nor were the minds of people <I>thoroughly prepared</I> for 
 him by repentance. From heaven John had received his <I>command,</I>
 and he would go on in his work till he thence received his 
 <I>countermand,</I> and would have his dismission from the same hand 
 that gave him his commission. He does not <I>come in</I> to Christ, 
 lest what had formerly passed should look like a combination between 
 them; but <I>he goes on</I> with his work, till Providence lays him 
 aside. The greater gifts of some do not <I>render</I> the labours of 
 others, that come short of them, <I>needless</I> and <I>useless;</I> 
 there is work enough for all hands. They are sullen that will sit down
 and do nothing when they see themselves out-shone. Though we have but 
 one talent, we must account for that: and, when we see ourselves 
 <I>going off,</I> must yet <I>go on</I> to the last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he baptized in Enon near Salim, places we find nowhere else 
 mentioned, and therefore the learned are altogether at a loss where to 
 find them. Wherever it was, it seems that John removed from <I>place to 
 place;</I> he did not think that there was any virtue in Jordan, 
 because Jesus was baptized there, which should engage him to stay 
 there, but as he saw cause he removed to other waters. Ministers must 
 follow their opportunities. He chose a place where there was much 
 water, <B><I>hydata polla</I></B>--<I>many waters,</I> that is, many
 <I>streams</I> of water; so that wherever he met with any that were 
 willing to submit to his baptism water was at hand to baptize them 
 with, <I>shallow</I> perhaps, as is usual where there are <I>many</I> 
 brooks, but such as would serve his purpose. And in that country plenty 
 of water was a valuable thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That thither people <I>came to him</I> and <I>were baptized.</I> 
 Though they did not come in such vast crowds as they did when he first 
 appeared, yet now he was not without encouragement, but there were 
 still those that attended and owned him. Some refer this both to John 
 and to Jesus: <I>They came and were baptized;</I> that is, some came to 
 John, and were baptized by him, some to Jesus, and were baptized by 
 him, and, as their baptism was one, so were their hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It is noted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 that <I>John was not yet cast into prison,</I> to clear the order of 
 the story, and to show that these passages are to come in before 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:12">Matt. vi. 12</A>.

 John never desisted from his work as long as he had his liberty; nay,
 he seems to have been the more industrious, because he foresaw his time 
 was short; he was not <I>yet cast into prison,</I> but he expected it 
 ere long,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:4"><I>ch.</I> ix. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A contest between <I>John's disciples and the Jews about 
 purifying,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 See how the gospel of Christ came not to <I>send peace upon earth,</I> 
 but <I>division.</I> Observe,

 1. Who were the disputants: <I>some of John's disciples, and the 
 Jews</I> who had not submitted to his baptism of repentance. Penitents 
 and impenitents divide this sinful world. In this contest, it should 
 seem, John's disciples were the <I>aggressors,</I> and gave the 
 <I>challenge;</I> and it is a sign that they were novices, who had more 
 zeal than discretion. The truths of God have often suffered by the 
 rashness of those that have undertaken to defend them before they were 
 able to do it.

 2. What was the matter in dispute: <I>about purifying,</I> about
 <I>religious washing.</I>

 (1.) We may suppose that John's disciples cried up his baptism, his
 purifying, as <I>instar omnium--superior to all others,</I> and gave 
 the preference to that as perfecting and superseding all the 
 purifications of the Jews, and they were in the right; but <I>young</I> 
 converts are too apt to boast of their attainments, whereas he that 
 finds the <I>treasure</I> should <I>hide it</I> till he is sure that he 
 has it, and not talk of it too much at first. 

 (2.) No doubt the Jews with as much assurance applauded the 
 <I>purifyings</I> that were in use among them, both those that were 
 instituted by the law of Moses and those that were imposed by the 
 tradition of the elders; for the former they had a divine warrant, and 
 for the latter the usage of the church. Now it is very likely that the
 Jews in this dispute, when they could not <I>deny</I> the excellent 
 nature and design of John's baptism, raised an objection against it 
 from Christ's baptism, which gave occasion for the complaint that 
 follows here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "Here is John baptizing in one place." say they, "and Jesus at the same 
 time baptizing in another place; and therefore John's baptism, which 
 his disciples so much applaud, is either,"

 [1.] "<I>Dangerous,</I> and of <I>ill consequence</I> to the peace of 
 the church and state, for you see it opens a door to endless parties. 
 Now that John has begun, we shall have every little teacher set up for 
 a baptist presently. Or," 

 [2.] "At the best it is <I>defective</I> and <I>imperfect.</I> If 
 John's baptism, which you cry up thus, have any good in it, yonder the 
 baptism of Jesus goes beyond it, so that for your parts you are shaded 
 already by a greater light, and your baptism is soon gone out of 
 request." Thus objections are made against the gospel from the 
 advancement and improvement of gospel light, as if childhood and 
 manhood were contrary to each other, and the superstructure were 
 against the foundation. There was no reason to object Christ's baptism 
 against John's, for they consisted very well together.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A complaint which John's disciples made to their master concerning
 Christ and his baptizing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 They, being <I>nonplussed</I> by the fore-mentioned objection, and 
 probably <I>ruffled</I> and put into a heat by it, come to their 
 master, and tell him, "<I>Rabbi, he that was with thee,</I> and was 
 baptized of thee, is now set up for himself; he <I>baptizeth, and all 
 men come to him;</I> and wilt thou suffer it?" Their itch for disputing 
 occasioned this. It is common for men, when they find themselves run 
 aground in the heat of disputation, to fall foul upon those that do 
 them no harm. If these disciples of John had not undertaken to dispute 
 about <I>purifying,</I> before they understood the <I>doctrine of 
 baptism,</I> they might have answered the objection without being put 
 into a passion. In their complaint, they speak respectfully to their 
 own master, <I>Rabbit;</I> but speak very slightly of our Saviour, 
 though they do not name him. 

 1. They suggest that Christ's setting up a baptism of his own was a
 piece of presumption, very unaccountable; as if John, having first set 
 up this rite of baptizing, must have the monopoly of it, and, as it 
 were, a patent for the invention: "<I>He that was with thee beyond 
 Jordan,</I> as a disciple of thine, <I>behold,</I> and wonder, <I>the 
 same,</I> the very same, <I>baptizes,</I> and takes thy work out of thy 
 hand." Thus the voluntary condescensions of the Lord Jesus, as that of 
 his being baptized by John, are often unjustly and very unkindly turned 
 to his reproach.

 2. They suggest that it was a piece of ingratitude to John. He <I>to
 whom thou barest witness</I> baptizes; as if Jesus owed all his 
 reputation to the honourable character John gave of him, and yet had 
 very unworthily improved it to the prejudice of John. But Christ needed 
 not John's testimony,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:36"><I>ch.</I> v. 36</A>.

 He reflected more honour upon John than he received from him, yet thus
 it is incident to us to think that others are more indebted to us than 
 really they are. And besides, Christ's baptism was not in the least an 
 <I>impeachment,</I> but indeed the greatest <I>improvement,</I> of 
 John's baptism, which was but to lead the way to Christ's. John was 
 <I>just</I> to Christ, in bearing witness to him; and Christ's 
 answering his testimony did rather enrich than impoverish John's 
 ministry. 

 3. They conclude that it would be a total eclipse to John's baptism:
 "<I>All men come to him;</I> they that used to follow with us now flock 
 after him, it is therefore time for us to look about us." It was not 
 indeed strange that <I>all men came to him.</I> As far as Christ is 
 <I>manifested</I> he will be <I>magnified;</I> but why should John's 
 disciples grieve at this? Note, Aiming at the monopoly of honour and 
 respect has been in all ages the bane of the church, and the shame of 
 its members and ministers; as also a vying of interests, and a jealousy 
 of rivalship and competition. We mistake if we think that the excelling 
 gifts and graces, and labours and usefulness, of one, are a diminution 
 and disparagement to another that has obtained mercy to be faithful; 
 for the Spirit is a free agent, <I>dispensing to every one severally as 
 he will.</I> Paul rejoiced in the usefulness even of those that 
 <I>opposed him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:18">Phil. i. 18</A>.

 We must leave it to God to choose, employ, and honour his own
 instruments as he pleaseth, and not covet to be <I>placed 
 alone.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is John's answer to this complaint which his disciples made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>,

 &c. His disciples expected that he would have resented this matter
 as they did; but Christ's <I>manifestation to Israel</I> was no 
 <I>surprise</I> to John, but what he looked for; it was not 
 <I>disturbance</I> to him, but what he wished for. He therefore checked 
 the complaint, as Moses, <I>Enviest thou for my sake?</I> and took this 
 occasion to confirm the testimonies he had formerly borne to Christ as 
 superior to him, cheerfully consigning and turning over to him all the 
 interest he had in Israel. In this discourse here, the first minister 
 of the gospel (for so John was) is an excellent pattern to all 
 ministers to <I>humble</I> themselves and to <I>exalt</I> the Lord 
 Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. John here <I>abases himself in comparison with Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:27-30"><I>v.</I> 27-30</A>.
 
 The more others magnify us, the more we must humble ourselves, and 
 fortify ourselves against the temptation of flattery and applause, and 
 the jealousy of our friends for our honour, by remembering our place, 
 and what we are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:5">1 Cor. iii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>John acquiesces</I> in the divine disposal, and satisfies 
 himself with that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>A man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven,</I> 
 whence <I>every good gift</I> comes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17">James i. 17</A>),

 a general truth very applicable in this case. Different employments are 
 according to the direction of divine Providence, different endowments 
 according to the distribution of the divine grace. <I>No man can
 take</I> any true <I>honour</I> to himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:4">Heb. v. 4</A>.

 We have as necessary and constant a dependence upon the grace of God in
 all the motions and actions of the spiritual life as we have upon the 
 providence of God in all the motions and actions of the natural life: 
 now this comes in here as a reason,

 [1.] Why we should not <I>envy</I> those that have a larger share of 
 gifts than we have, or move in a larger sphere of usefulness. John 
 reminds his disciples that Jesus would not have thus excelled him 
 <I>except he had received it from heaven,</I> for, as <I>man</I> and 
 <I>Mediator,</I> he <I>received gifts;</I> and, if God gave him <I>the 
 Spirit without measure</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 shall they grudge at it? The same reason will hold as to others. If
 God is <I>pleased</I> to give to others more ability and success than 
 to us, shall we be displeased at it, and reflect upon him as unjust, 
 unwise, and partial? See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:15">Matt. xx. 15</A>.

 [2.] Why we should not be <I>discontented,</I> though we be inferior to 
 others in gifts and usefulness, and be eclipsed by their excellencies. 
 John was ready to own that it was the gift, the free gift, of heaven, 
 that made him a preacher, a prophet, a baptist: it was God that gave 
 him the interest he had in the love and esteem of the people; and, if 
 now his interest decline, God's will be done! He that <I>gives</I> may 
 <I>take.</I> What we <I>receive</I> from heaven we must take as it is 
 <I>given.</I> Now John never received a commission for a standing 
 <I>perpetual</I> office, but only for a <I>temporary</I> one, which 
 must soon expire; and therefore, when he has fulfilled his ministry, he 
 can contentedly see it go out of date. Some give quite another sense of 
 these words: John had taken pains with his disciples, to teach them the 
 reference which his baptism had to Christ, who should come after him, 
 and yet be preferred before him, and do that for them which he could 
 not do; and yet, after all, they dote upon John, and grudge this 
 preference of Christ above him: Well saith John, I see <I>a man can 
 receive</I> (that is, perceive) <I>nothing, except it be given him from 
 heaven.</I> The labour of ministers if all lost labour, unless the 
 grace of God make it effectual. Men do not understand that which is 
 made most <I>plain,</I> nor believe that which is made most 
 <I>evident,</I> unless it be given them from heaven to understand and 
 believe it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) John appeals to the testimony he had formerly given concerning 
 Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 You can bear me witness that I said, again and again, <I>I am not the 
 Christ, but I am sent before him.</I> See how steady and constant John 
 was in his testimony to Christ, and not as a <I>reed shaken with the 
 wind;</I> neither the frowns of the chief priests, nor the flatteries 
 of his own disciples, could make him change his note. Now this serves
 here,

 [1.] As a <I>conviction</I> to his disciples of the unreasonableness of 
 their complaint. They had spoken of the witness which their master bore 
 to Jesus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "Now," saith John, "do you not remember what the testimony was that I 
 did bear? Call that to mind, and you will see your own cavil answered. 
 Did I not say, <I>I am not the Christ?</I> Why then do you set me up as 
 a rival with him that is? Did I not say, <I>I am sent before him?</I>
 Why then does it seem strange to you that I should stand by and give 
 way to him?"

 [2.] It is a <I>comfort</I> to himself that he had never <I>given</I> 
 his disciples <I>any occasion</I> thus to set him up in competition 
 with Christ; but, on the contrary, had particularly <I>cautioned</I> 
 them against this mistake, though he might have made a hand of it for 
 himself. It is a satisfaction to faithful ministers when they have done 
 what they could in their places to prevent any extravagances that their 
 people ran into. John had not only not encouraged them to hope that he 
 was the Messiah, but had plainly told them the contrary, which was now 
 a satisfaction to him. It is a common excuse for those who have undue 
 honour paid them, <I>Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur--If the people 
 will be deceived, let them;</I> but that is an ill maxim for those to 
 go by whose business it is to <I>undeceive</I> people. <I>The lip of 
 truth shall be established.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) John professes the great satisfaction he had in the advancement of 
 Christ and his interest. He was so far from <I>regretting</I> it, as 
 his disciples did, that he <I>rejoiced</I> in it. This he expresses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)
 
 by an elegant similitude.

 [1.] He compares our Saviour to the <I>bridegroom: "He that hath the 
 bride is the bridegroom.</I> Do <I>all men come to him?</I> It is well, 
 whither else should they go? Has he got the throne in men's affections? 
 Who else should have it? It is his right; to whom should the bride be 
 brought but to the bridegroom?" Christ was prophesied of in the Old 
 Testament as a bridegroom, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1-17">Ps. xlv</A>.

 <I>The Word was made flesh,</I> that the disparity of nature might not
 be a <I>bar to the match.</I> Provision is made for the purifying of 
 the church, that the defilement of sin might be no bar. Christ espouses 
 his church to himself; he <I>has</I> the bride, for he has her love, he 
 has her promise; <I>the church is subject to Christ.</I> As far as 
 particular souls are devoted to him in faith and love, so far the 
 bridegroom has the bride.

 [2.] He compares himself to the <I>friend of the bridegroom,</I> who 
 attends upon him, to do him honour and service, assists him in 
 prosecuting the match, speaks a good word for him, uses his interest on 
 his behalf, rejoices when the match goes on, and most of all when the 
 point is gained, and he <I>has the bride.</I> All that John had done in 
 preaching and baptizing was to introduce him; and, now that he was 
 come, he had what he wished for: <I>The friend of the bridegroom 
 stands, and hears him;</I> stands expecting him, and waiting for him; 
 <I>rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice,</I> because he 
 is come to the marriage after he had been long expected. Note,
 <I>First,</I> Faithful ministers are friends of the bridegroom, to 
 recommend him to the affections and choice of the children of men; to 
 bring letters and messages from him, for he courts by proxy; and herein 
 they must be faithful to him. <I>Secondly,</I> The friends of the 
 bridegroom must <I>stand, and hear the bridegroom's voice;</I> must 
 receive instructions from him, and attend his orders; must desire to 
 have proofs of Christ speaking in them, and with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:3">2 Cor. xiii. 3</A>);
 
 that is the <I>bridegroom's voice. Thirdly,</I> The espousing of souls 
 to Jesus Christ, in faith and love, is the fulfilling of the joy of 
 every good minister. If the day of Christ's espousals be the day of the 
 gladness of his heart 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11">Cant. iii. 11</A>),

 it cannot but be of their too who love him and wish well to his honour 
 and kingdom. Surely they have <I>no greater joy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He owns it highly fit and necessary that the reputation and 
 interest of Christ should be advanced, and his own diminished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):
 
 <I>He must increase, but I must decrease.</I> If they grieve at the 
 growing greatness of the Lord Jesus, they will have more and more 
 occasion to grieve, as those have that indulge themselves in envy and 
 emulation. John speaks of Christ's increase and his own decrease, not 
 only as <I>necessary</I> and <I>unavoidable,</I> which could not be 
 <I>helped</I> and therefore must be <I>borne,</I> but as highly 
 <I>just</I> and <I>agreeable,</I> and affording him entire 
 satisfaction. 

 [1.] He was <I>well pleased</I> to see the kingdom of Christ getting 
 ground: "<I>He must increase.</I> You think he has gained a great deal, 
 but it is nothing to what he will gain." Note, The kingdom of Christ 
 is, and will be, a growing kingdom, like the light of the morning, like 
 the grain of mustard-seed. 

 [2.] He was not at all <I>displeased</I> that the effect of this was 
 the diminishing of his own interest: <I>I must decrease.</I> Created 
 excellencies are under this law, they <I>must decrease. I have seen an 
 end of all perfection.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> The shining forth of the 
 glory of Christ eclipses the lustre of all other glory. The glory that 
 stands in <I>competition</I> with Christ, that of the world and the 
 flesh, decreases and loses ground in the soul as the knowledge and love 
 of Christ increase and get ground; but it is here spoken of that which 
 is <I>subservient</I> to him. As the light of the morning increases, 
 that of the morning star decreases. <I>Secondly,</I> If our diminution 
 or abasement may but in the least contribute to the advancement of 
 Christ's name, we must cheerfully submit to it, and be content to be 
 <I>any thing,</I> to be <I>nothing,</I> so that Christ may be 
 <I>all.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. John Baptist here <I>advances</I> Christ, and instructs his 
 disciples concerning him, that, instead of grieving that so many come 
 to him, they might come to him themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He instructs them concerning the <I>dignity of Christ's person</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>He that cometh from above,</I> that <I>cometh from heaven, is above 
 all.</I> Here,

 [1.] He supposes his divine origin, that he came <I>from above,</I> 
 from <I>heaven,</I> which bespeaks not only his divine extraction, but 
 his divine nature. He had a being before his conception, a heavenly 
 being. None but he that came from heaven was fit to show us the will of 
 heaven, or the way to heaven. When God would save man, he <I>sent from 
 above.</I> 

 [2.] Hence he infers his sovereign authority: he is <I>above all,</I> 
 above all things and all persons, <I>God over all, blessed for 
 evermore.</I> It is daring presumption to dispute precedency with him.
 When we come to speak of the honours of the Lord Jesus, we find they 
 transcend all conception and expression, and we can say but this, <I>He 
 is above all.</I> It was said of John Baptist, <I>There is not a 
 greater among them that are born of women.</I> But the descent of 
 Christ from heaven put such a dignity upon him as he was not divested 
 of by his being made flesh; still he was <I>above all.</I> This he 
 further illustrates by the meanness of those who stood in competition 
 with him: <I>He that is of the earth, is earthly,</I> <B><I>ho on ek 
 tes ges, ek tes ges esti</I></B>--<I>He that is of the earth is of the 
 earth;</I> he that has his origin of the earth has his food out of the 
 earth, has his converse with earthly things, and his concern is for 
 them. Note, <I>First,</I> Man has his rise out of the earth; not only
 Adam at first, but we also still are <I>formed out of the clay,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:6">Job xxxiii. 6</A>.

 Look to the rock whence we were hewn. <I>Secondly,</I> Man's
 constitution is therefore <I>earthly;</I> not only his body frail and 
 mortal, but his soul corrupt and carnal, and its bent and bias strong 
 towards earthly things. The prophets and apostles were of the same 
 mould with other men; they were but <I>earthen vessels,</I> though they 
 had a rich treasure lodged in them; and shall these be set up as rivals 
 with Christ? <I>Let the potsherds strive with the potsherds of the 
 earth;</I> but let them not cope with him that <I>came from 
 heaven.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Concerning the <I>excellency and certainty of his doctrine.</I> 
 His disciples were displeased that Christ's preaching was admired, and 
 attended upon, more than his; but he tells them that there was reason 
 enough for it. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He, for his part, <I>spoke of the earth,</I> and so do all those 
 that are <I>of the earth.</I> The prophets were men and spoke like men; 
 <I>of themselves</I> they could not speak but <I>of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:5">2 Cor. iii. 5</A>.

 The preaching of the prophets and of John was but low and flat compared
 with Christ's preaching; as heaven is high above the earth, so were his 
 thoughts above theirs. By them God spoke <I>on earth,</I> but in Christ 
 he speaketh <I>from heaven.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] But he that cometh from heaven is not only in his person, but in 
 his doctrine, above all the prophets that ever lived on earth; none 
 teacheth like him. The doctrine of Christ is here recommended to 
 us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> As infallibly <I>sure</I> and <I>certain,</I> and to be 
 entertained accordingly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>What he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth.</I> See here, 

 1. Christ's divine knowledge; he testified nothing but <I>what he had
 seen and heard,</I> what he was perfectly apprized of and thoroughly 
 acquainted with. What he discovered of the divine nature and of the 
 invisible world was what he had <I>seen;</I> what he revealed of the 
 mind of God was what he had <I>heard</I> immediately from him, and not 
 at second hand. The prophets testified what was made known to them in 
 creams and visions by the mediation of angels, but not what they had 
 seen and heard. John was the crier's <I>voice,</I> that said, "<I>Make 
 room for the witness,</I> and <I>keep silence</I> while the charge is 
 given," but then leaves it to the witness to give in his testimony 
 himself, and the judge to give the charge himself. The gospel of Christ 
 is not a doubtful opinion, like an hypothesis or new notion in 
 philosophy, which every one is at liberty to believe or not; but it is 
 a revelation of the mind of God, which is of <I>eternal truth</I> in 
 itself, and of <I>infinite concern</I> to us. 

 2. His divine grace and goodness: that which he had <I>seen</I> and
 <I>heard</I> he was pleased to make known to us, because he knew it 
 nearly concerned us. What Paul had seen and heard in the third heavens 
 he could not testify

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:4">2 Cor. xii. 4</A>),

 but Christ knew how to utter what he had <I>seen</I> and <I>heard.</I> 
 Christ's preaching is here called his <I>testifying,</I> to denote, 
 
 (1.) The <I>convincing evidence</I> of it; it was not <I>reported</I> 
 as news by hearsay, but it was <I>testified</I> as evidence given in 
 court, with great caution and assurance. 

 (2.) The affectionate earnestness of the delivery of it: it was
 testified with concern and importunity, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:5">Acts xviii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From the <I>certainty</I> of Christ's doctrine, John takes occasion, 
 
 [1.] To lament the infidelity of the most of men: though he testifies 
 what is infallibly true, yet <I>no man re</I>ceiveth his testimony, 
 that is, very few, next to none, none in comparison with those that 
 refuse it. They receive it not, they will not hear it, they do not heed 
 it, or give credit to it. This he speaks of not only as a matter of 
 <I>wonder,</I> that such a testimony should not be received (Who hath
 believed our report? How stupid and foolish are the greatest part of
 mankind, what enemies to themselves!) but as matter of <I>grief;</I> 
 John's disciples grieved that <I>all men came to Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);
 
 they thought his followers too many. But John grieves that <I>no man 
 came to him;</I> he thought them too few. Note, The unbelief of sinners 
 is the grief of saints. It was for this that St. Paul had <I>great 
 heaviness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:2">Rom. ix. 2</A>.

 [2.] He takes occasion to commend the faith of the chosen remnant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>He that hath received his testimony</I> (and some such there were,
 though very few) hath <I>set to his seal that God is true.</I> God is 
 true, though we do not <I>set our seal to it;</I> let God be true, and 
 every man a liar; his truth needs not our faith to support it, but by 
 faith we do ourselves the honour and justice to subscribe to his truth, 
 and hereby God reckons himself honoured. God's promises are all <I>yea 
 and amen;</I> by faith we put our <I>amen</I> to them, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:20">Rev. xxii. 20</A>.

 Observe, He that receives the testimony of Christ subscribes not only 
 to the truth of Christ, but to the truth of <I>God,</I> for his name is 
 the <I>Word of God;</I> the commandments of God and the testimony of 
 Christ are put together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:17">Rev. xii. 17</A>.

 By believing in Christ we set to our seal, <I>First,</I> That God is 
 true to all the promises which he has made <I>concerning Christ,</I> 
 that which he spoke by the mouth of <I>all his holy prophets;</I> what 
 he <I>swore to our fathers</I> is all accomplished, and not one iota or 
 tittle of it fallen to the ground,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:70,Ac+13:32,33">Luke i. 70, &c. Acts xiii. 32, 33</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> That he is true to all the promises he has made <I>in
 Christ;</I> we venture our souls upon God's veracity, being satisfied 
 that he is <I>true;</I> we are willing to deal with him <I>upon 
 trust,</I> and to quit all in this world for a happiness in reversion 
 and out of sight. By this we greatly honour God's faithfulness. Whom we 
 <I>give credit</I> to we <I>give honour</I> to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> It is recommended to us as a <I>divine</I> doctrine; 
 not his own, but <I>his that sent</I> him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the word of God,</I> which he was 
 sent to speak, and enabled to speak; <I>for God giveth not the Spirit 
 by measure unto him.</I> The prophets were as messengers that brought 
 letters from heaven; but Christ came under the character of an 
 <I>ambassador,</I> and treats with us as such; for, 

 1. He spoke the <I>words of God,</I> and nothing he said savoured of
 human infirmity; both substance and language were divine. He proved 
 himself <I>sent of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:2"><I>ch.</I> iii. 2</A>),

 and therefore his words are to be received as the words of God. By this
 rule we may try the spirits: those that speak <I>as the oracles of 
 God,</I> and prophesy <I>according to the proportion of faith,</I> are 
 to be received as <I>sent of God.</I> 

 2. He spoke as no other prophet did; for <I>God giveth not the Spirit
 by measure to him.</I> None can speak the <I>words of God</I> without 
 the <I>Spirit of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:10,11">1 Cor. ii. 10, 11</A>.

 The Old-Testament prophets had the Spirit, and in different degrees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:9,10">2 Kings ii. 9, 10</A>.

 But, whereas God gave them the Spirit by <I>measure</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:4">1 Cor. xii. 4</A>),
 
 he gave him to Christ <I>without measure;</I> all fulness dwelt in him, 
 the fulness of the Godhead, an immeasurable fulness. The Spirit was not 
 in Christ as in a vessel, but as in a fountain, as in a bottomless 
 ocean. "The prophets that had the Spirit in a limited manner, only with 
 respect to some particular revelation, sometimes spoke of 
 <I>themselves;</I> but he that had the Spirit always residing in him, 
 without stint, always spoke <I>the words of God.</I>" So Dr.
 Whitby.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Concerning <I>the power and authority he is invested with,</I> 
 which gives him the pre-eminence above all others, and a more excellent 
 name than they.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He is the <I>beloved Son of the Father</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>The Father loveth the Son.</I> The prophets were faithful as 
 servants, but Christ as a Son; they were employed as servants, but 
 Christ <I>beloved</I> as a son, always <I>his delight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>.
 
 The Father was well pleased in him; not only he <I>did</I> love him, 
 but he <I>doth</I> love him; he continued his love to him even in his 
 estate of humiliation, loved him never the less for his poverty and 
 sufferings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He is <I>Lord of all.</I> The Father, as an evidence of his love 
 for him, <I>hath given all things into his hand.</I> Love is generous. 
 The Father took such a complacency and had such a confidence in him 
 that he constituted him the great <I>feoffee in trust</I> for mankind. 
 Having given <I>him the Spirit without measure,</I> he gave him <I>all 
 things;</I> for he was hereby qualified to be master and manager of 
 all. Note, It is the honour of Christ, and the unspeakable comfort of 
 all Christians, that the Father hath <I>given all things</I> into the 
 hands of the Mediator. <I>First,</I> All <I>power;</I> so it is 
 explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:18">Matt. xxviii. 18</A>.

 All the works of creation being put under his feet, all the affairs of
 redemption are put into his hand; he is Lord of all. Angels are his 
 servants; devils are his captives. He has <I>power over all flesh,</I> 
 the <I>heathen</I> given <I>him for his inheritance.</I> The kingdom of 
 providence is committed to his administration. He has power to settle 
 the terms of the covenant of peace as the great <I>plenipotentiary,</I> 
 to govern his church as the great <I>lawgiver,</I> to dispense divine 
 favours as the great <I>almoner,</I> and to call all to account as the 
 great <I>Judge.</I> Both the golden sceptre and the iron rod are given 
 into his hand. <I>Secondly,</I> All <I>grace</I> is given into his
 hand as the channel of conveyance; <I>all things,</I> all those good 
 things which God intended to give to the children of men; <I>eternal 
 life,</I> and all its preliminaries. We are unworthy that the Father 
 should give those things <I>into our hands,</I> for we have made 
 ourselves the <I>children of his wrath;</I> he hath therefore appointed 
 the <I>Son of his love</I> to be trustee for us, and the things he 
 intended for us he gives <I>into his hands,</I> who is worthy, and has 
 merited both honours for himself and favours for us. They are given 
 <I>into his hands,</I> by him to be given into ours. This is a great 
 encouragement to faith, that the riches of the new covenant are 
 deposited in so sure, so kind, so good a hand, the hand of him that 
 purchased them for us, and us for himself, who is able to keep all that 
 which both God and believers have agreed to <I>commit to him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] He is the object of that faith which is made the great condition 
 of eternal happiness, and herein he has the pre-eminence above all 
 others: <I>He that believeth on the Son, hath life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 We have here the application of what he had said concerning Christ and 
 his doctrine; and it is the <I>conclusion of the whole matter.</I> If 
 God has put this honour upon the Son, we must by faith give honour to 
 him. As God offers and conveys good things to us by the
 <I>testimony</I> of Jesus Christ, whose word is the vehicle of divine 
 favours, so we receive and partake of those favours by <I>believing</I> 
 the testimony, and entertaining that word as <I>true</I> and 
 <I>good;</I> this way of <I>receiving</I> fitly answers that way of 
 <I>giving.</I> We have here the sum of that gospel which is to be 
 preached to every creature, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:16">Mark xvi. 16</A>.
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The blessed state of all true Christians: <I>He that
 believes on the Son hath everlasting life.</I> Note, 

 1. It is the character of every true Christian that he believes on 
 <I>the Son of God;</I> not only <I>believes him,</I> that what he saith 
 is true, but believes <I>on him,</I> consents to him, and confides in 
 him. The benefit of true Christianity is no less than <I>everlasting 
 life;</I> this is what Christ came to purchase for us and confer upon 
 us; it can be no less than the happiness of an immortal soul <I>in</I> 
 an immortal God.

 2. True believers, even now, <I>have</I> everlasting life; not only
 they shall have it hereafter, but they have it now. For,

 (1.) They <I>have</I> very good security for it. The deed by which it
 passeth is sealed and delivered to them, and so they <I>have</I> it; it 
 is put into the hands of their guardian for them, and so they have it, 
 though the use be not yet transferred into possession. They have the 
 Son of God, and in him <I>they have life;</I> and the Spirit of God, 
 the earnest of this life. 

 (2.) They have the comfortable <I>foretastes</I> of it, in present 
 communion with God and the tokens of his love. Grace is glory 
 begun.</P>
