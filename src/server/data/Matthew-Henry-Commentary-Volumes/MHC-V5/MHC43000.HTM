 It is not material to enquire when and where this gospel was written; 
 we are sure that it was given by inspiration of God to John, the 
 brother of James, one of the twelve apostles, distinguished by the 
 honourable character of <I>that disciple whom Jesus loved,</I> one of 
 the first three of the worthies of the Son of David, whom he took to be 
 the witnesses of his retirements, particularly of his transfiguration 
 and his agony. The ancients tell us that John lived longest of all the 
 twelve apostles, and was the only one of them that died a natural 
 death, all the rest suffering martyrdom; and some of them say that he 
 wrote this gospel at Ephesus, at the request of the ministers of the 
 several churches of Asia, in opposition to the heresy of Corinthus and 
 the Ebionites, who held that our Lord was a <I>mere man.</I> It seems 
 most probable that he wrote it before his banishment into the isle of 
 Patmos, for there he wrote his <I>Apocalypse,</I> the close of which 
 seems designed for the closing up of the canon of scripture; and, if 
 so, this gospel was not written after. I cannot therefore give credit 
 to those later fathers, who say that he wrote it in his banishment, or 
 after his return from it, many years after the destruction of 
 Jerusalem; when he was ninety years old, saith one of them; when he was 
 a hundred, saith another of them. However, it is clear that he wrote 
 last of the four evangelists, and, comparing his gospel with theirs, we 
 may observe, 

 1. That he <I>relates</I> what they had <I>omitted;</I> he <I>brings up
 the rear,</I> and his gospel is as the <I>rearward</I> or <I>gathering 
 host;</I> it gleans up what they has passed by. Thus there was a 
 <I>later</I> collection of Solomon's wise sayings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:1">Prov. xxv. 1</A>),
 
 and yet far short of what he delivered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:32">1 Kings iv. 32</A>.

 2. That he gives us more of the <I>mystery</I> of that of which the
 other evangelists gave us only the <I>history.</I> It was necessary 
 that the matters of fact should be first settled, which was done in 
 their <I>declarations of those things which Jesus began both to do and 
 teach,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:1,Ac+1:1">Luke i. 1; Acts i. 1</A>.

 But, this being done out of the mouth of two or three witnesses,
 <I>John goes on to perfection</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:1">Heb. vi. 1</A>),

 <I>not laying again the foundation,</I> but building upon it, leading
 us more within the veil. Some of the ancients observe that the other
 evangelists wrote more of the <B><I>ta somatika</I></B>--the 
 <I>bodily</I> things of Christ; but John writes of the <B><I>ta 
 pneumatika</I></B>--the <I>spiritual</I> things of the gospel, the life 
 and soul of it; therefore some have called this gospel the <I>key of 
 the evangelists.</I> Here is it that a <I>door</I> is <I>opened in 
 heaven,</I> and the first voice we hear is, <I>Come up hither,</I> come 
 up higher. Some of the ancients, that supposed the four living 
 creatures in John's vision to represent the for evangelists, make John 
 himself to be the <I>flying eagle,</I> so <I>high</I> does he 
 <I>soar,</I> and <I>so clearly</I> does he <I>see</I> into divine and 
 heavenly things.</P>
