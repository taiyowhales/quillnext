 It was, more than any thing else, the glory of the land of Israel, that 
 it was Emmanuel's land 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:8">Isa. viii. 8</A>),

 not only the place of his birth, but the scene of his preaching and
 miracles. This land in our Saviour's time was divided into three parts:
 Judea in the south, Galilee in the north, and Samaria lying between 
 them. Now, in this chapter, we have Christ in each of these three parts 
 of that land. 
 
 I. Departing out of Judea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. Passing through Samaria, which, though a visit in transitu, here
 takes up most room. 
 
 1. His coming into Samaria,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 2. His discourse with the Samaritan woman at a well, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:7-26">ver. 7-26</A>.

 3. The notice which the woman gave of him to the city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:27-30">ver. 27-30</A>.
 
 4. Christ's talk with his disciples in the meantime, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:31-38">ver. 31-38</A>.

 5. The good effect of this among the Samaritans, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:39-42">ver. 39-42</A>.

 III. We find him residing for some time in Galilee 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:43-46">ver. 43-46</A>),

 and his curing a nobleman's son there, that was at death's door,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:46-54">ver. 46-54</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that
 Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
 &nbsp; 2  (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
 &nbsp; 3  He left Jud&aelig;a, and departed again into Galilee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We read of Christ's coming into Judea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:22"><I>ch.</I> iii. 22</A>),

 after he had kept the feast at Jerusalem; and now he left Judea four
 months before harvest, as is said here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 so that it is computed that he staid in Judea about six months, to 
 build upon the foundation John had laid there. We have no particular 
 account of his sermons and miracles there, only in general, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That he <I>made disciples;</I> he prevailed with many to embrace his 
 doctrine, and to follow him as a teacher come from God. His ministry 
 was successful, notwithstanding the opposition it met with 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:2,3">Ps. cx. 2, 3</A>);

 <B><I>mathetas poiei</I></B>--it signifies the same with 
 <B><I>matheteuo</I></B>--<I>to disciples.</I> Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:5">Gen. xii. 5</A>.
 
 <I>The souls which they had gotten,</I> which they had <I>made</I> (so
 the word is), which they had <I>made proselytes.</I> Note, It is 
 Christ's prerogative to <I>make disciples,</I> first to bring them to 
 his foot, and then to form and fashion them to his will. <I>Fit, non 
 nascitur, Christianus--The Christian is made such, not born such.</I> 
 Tertullian.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he <I>baptized</I> those whom he <I>made disciples,</I> 
 admitted them by <I>washing them with water;</I> not himself, but by 
 the ministry of his disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 1. Because he would put a difference between his baptism and that of 
 John, who baptized all himself; for he baptized as a servant, Christ as 
 a master. 

 2. He would apply himself more to preaching work, which was the more
 excellent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:17">1 Cor. i. 17</A>.

 3. He would put honour upon his disciples, by empowering and employing
 them to do it; and so train them up to further services. 

 4. If he had baptized some himself, they would have been apt to value
 themselves upon that, and despise others, which he would prevent, as 
 Paul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:13,14">1 Cor. i. 13, 14</A>.

 5. He would reserve himself for the honour of baptizing with the Holy
 Ghost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:5">Acts i. 5</A>.

 6. He would teach us that the efficacy of the sacraments depends not on
 any virtue in the hand that administers them, as also that what is done 
 by his ministers, according to his direction, he owns as done by 
 himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That he made and baptized <I>more disciples than John;</I> not 
 only more than John did at this time, but more than he had done at any 
 time. Christ's converse was more winning than John's. His miracles were 
 convincing, and the cures he wrought <I>gratis</I> very inviting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the Pharisees were informed of this; they heard what 
 multitudes he baptized, for they had, from his first appearing, a 
 jealous eye upon him, and wanted not spies to give them notice 
 concerning him. Observe, 

 1. When the Pharisees thought they had got rid of John (for he was by 
 this time imprisoned), and were pleasing themselves with that, Jesus 
 appears, who was a greater vexation to them than ever John had been. 
 The witnesses will rise again. 

 2. That which grieved them was that Christ made so many disciples. The 
 success of the gospel exasperates its enemies, and it is a good sign 
 that it is getting ground when the powers of darkness are enraged 
 against it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That our Lord Jesus knew very well what informations were given in 
 against him to the Pharisees. It is probable the informers were willing 
 to have their names concealed, and the Pharisees loth to have their 
 designs known; but none can dig so keep as to <I>hide their counsels 
 from the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:15">Isa. xxix. 15</A>),

 and Christ is here called <I>the Lord.</I> He knew what was told the 
 Pharisees, and how much, it is likely, it exceeded the truth; for it is 
 not likely that Jesus had yet baptized <I>more than John;</I> but so 
 the thing was represented, to make him appear the more formidable; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:12">2 Kings vi. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That hereupon our Lord Jesus <I>left Judea</I> and <I>departed 
 again</I> to go to Galilee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He <I>left Judea,</I> because he was likely to be persecuted there 
 even to the death; such was the rage of the Pharisees against him, and 
 such their impious policy to devour the man-child in his infancy. To 
 escape their designs, Christ quitted the country, and went where what 
 he did would be less provoking than just under their eye. For, 

 (1.) His hour was not yet come

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:30"><I>ch.</I> vii. 30</A>),

 the time fixed in the counsels of God, and the Old-Testament
 prophecies, for Messiah's being cut off. He had not finished his 
 testimony, and therefore would not surrender or expose himself. 

 (2.) The disciples he had gathered in Judea were not able to bear 
 hardships, and therefore he would not expose them. 

 (3.) Hereby he gave an example to his own rule: <I>When they persecute 
 you in one city, flee to another.</I> We are not called to suffer, 
 while we may avoid it without sin; and therefore, though we may not, 
 for our own preservation, change our religion, yet we may change our 
 place. Christ secured himself, not by a miracle, but in a way <I>common 
 to men,</I> for the direction and encouragement of his suffering 
 people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He departed into Galilee, because he had work to do there, and many 
 friends and fewer enemies. He went to Galilee now, 

 (1.) Because John's ministry had now <I>made way</I> for him there; for 
 Galilee, which was under Herod's jurisdiction, was the last scene of 
 John's baptism. 

 (2.) Because John's imprisonment had now <I>made room</I> for him 
 there. That light being now put under a bushel, the minds of people
 would not be divided between him and Christ. Thus both the liberties 
 and restraints of good ministers are for the furtherance of the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:12">Phil. i. 12</A>.

 But to what purpose does he go into Galilee for safety? Herod, the
 persecutor of John, will never be the protector of Jesus. Chemnitius
 here notes, <I>Pii in h&aacute;c vit&acute; quos fugiant habent; ad 
 quos vero fugiant ut in tuto sint non habent, nisi ad te, Deus, qui 
 solus regugium nostrum es</I>--<I>The pious have those, in this life, 
 to whom they can fly; but they have none to fly to, who can afford them 
 refuge, except thee, O God.</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And he must needs go through Samaria.
 &nbsp; 5  Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar,
 near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
 &nbsp; 6  Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied
 with <I>his</I> journey, sat thus on the well: <I>and</I> it was about the
 sixth hour.
 &nbsp; 7  There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith
 unto her, Give me to drink.
 &nbsp; 8  (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
 &nbsp; 9  Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that
 thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of
 Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
 &nbsp; 10  Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift
 of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
 wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living
 water.
 &nbsp; 11  The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw
 with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that
 living water?
 &nbsp; 12  Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the
 well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his
 cattle?
 &nbsp; 13  Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this
 water shall thirst again:
 &nbsp; 14  But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
 shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be
 in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
 &nbsp; 15  The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I
 thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
 &nbsp; 16  Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
 &nbsp; 17  The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said
 unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
 &nbsp; 18  For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast
 is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
 &nbsp; 19  The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
 prophet.
 &nbsp; 20  Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
 Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
 &nbsp; 21  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh,
 when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,
 worship the Father.
 &nbsp; 22  Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
 salvation is of the Jews.
 &nbsp; 23  But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
 shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father
 seeketh such to worship him.
 &nbsp; 24  God <I>is</I> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship
 <I>him</I> in spirit and in truth.
 &nbsp; 25  The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which
 is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
 &nbsp; 26  Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am <I>he.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the good Christ did in Samaria, when he 
 <I>passed through</I> that country in his way to Galilee. The 
 Samaritans, both in <I>blood</I> and <I>religion,</I> were <I>mongrel 
 Jews,</I> the posterity of those colonies which the king of Assyria 
 planted there after the captivity of the ten tribes, with whom the poor 
 of the land that were left behind, and many other Jews afterwards, 
 incorporated themselves. They worshipped the God of Israel only, to 
 whom they erected a temple on mount Gerizim, in competition with that 
 at Jerusalem. There was great enmity between them and the Jews; the 
 Samaritans would not admit Christ, when they saw he was going to 
 Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:53">Luke ix. 53</A>);

 the Jews thought they could not give him a worse name than to say, 
 <I>He is a Samaritan.</I> When the Jews were in prosperity, the 
 Samaritans claimed kindred to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:2">Ezra iv. 2</A>),

 but, when the Jews were in distress, they were Medes and Persians; see 
 Joseph. <I>Antiq.</I> 11. 340-341; 12. 257. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's coming into Samaria. He charged his disciples not to 
 <I>enter into any city of the Samaritans</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:5">Matt. x. 5</A>),

 that is, not to preach the gospel, or work miracles; nor did he here 
 preach publicly, or work any miracle, his eye being to <I>the lost 
 sheep of the house of Israel.</I> What kindness he here did them was 
 <I>accidental;</I> it was only a <I>crumb</I> of the children's bread 
 that casually <I>fell from the master's table.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His <I>road</I> from Judea to Galilee lay through the <I>country</I> 
 of Samaria 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>He must needs go through Samaria.</I> There was no other way, unless 
 he would have fetched a compass on the other side <I>Jordan,</I> a 
 great way about. The wicked and profane are at present so intermixed 
 with God's Israel that, unless we will go <I>out of the world,</I> we 
 cannot avoid <I>going through</I> the company of such, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:10">1 Cor. v. 10</A>.

 We have therefore need of the armour or righteousness on the right hand
 and on the left, that we may neither give <I>provocation</I> to them 
 nor contract <I>pollution</I> by them. We should not go into places of 
 temptation but when we <I>needs must;</I> and then we should not reside 
 in them, but <I>hasten through</I> them. Some think that Christ
 <I>must needs</I> go through Samaria because of the good work he had to 
 do there; a poor woman to be converted, a lost sheep to be sought and 
 saved. This was work his heart was upon, the <I>therefore</I> he 
 <I>must needs</I> go this way. It was happy for Samaria that it lay 
 <I>in Christ's way,</I> which gave him an opportunity of calling on 
 them. <I>When I passed by thee, I said unto thee, Live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:6">Ezek. xvi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His baiting place happened to be at a <I>city of Samaria.</I> Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The place described. It was called <I>Sychar;</I> probably the
 same with <I>Sichem,</I> or <I>Shechem,</I> a place which we read much 
 of in the Old Testament. Thus are the names of places commonly 
 corrupted by tract of time. Shechem yielded the first proselyte that 
 ever came into the church of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:24">Gen. xxxiv. 24</A>),

 and now it is the first place where the gospel is preached out of the 
 commonwealth of Israel; so Dr. Lightfoot observes; as also that the
 <I>valley of Achor,</I> which was given for a <I>door of hope,</I> hope 
 to the poor Gentiles, ran along by this city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:15">Hos. ii. 15</A>.

 Abimelech was made king here; it was Jeroboam's royal seat; but the
 evangelist, when he would give us the antiquities of the place, takes 
 notice of Jacob's interest there, which was more its honour than its 
 crowned heads.

 [1.] Here lay Jacob's ground, the <I>parcel of ground which Jacob</I> 
 gave to his son Joseph, whose bones were buried in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:22,Jos+24:32">Gen. xlviii. 22; Josh. xxiv. 32</A>.

 Probably this is mentioned to intimate that Christ, when he reposed
 himself hard by here, took occasion from the ground which Jacob gave 
 Joseph to meditate on the good report which the elders by faith 
 obtained. Jerome chose to live in the land of Canaan, that the sight of 
 the places might affect him the more with scripture stories.

 [2.] Here was Jacob's well which he digged, or at least used, for 
 himself and his family. We find no mention of this well in the Old 
 Testament; but the tradition was that it was Jacob's well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The posture of our Lord Jesus at this place: <I>Being wearied with 
 his journey, he sat thus on the well.</I> We have here our Lord 
 Jesus,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Labouring under the common fatigue of travellers. He was 
 <I>wearied with his journey.</I> Though it was yet but the sixth hour, 
 and he had performed but half his day's journey, yet he was weary; or, 
 <I>because</I> it was the sixth hour, the time of the heat of the day, 
 therefore he was weary. Here we see, <I>First,</I> That he was a 
 <I>true man,</I> and subject to the common infirmities of the human 
 nature. Toil came in with sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19">Gen. iii. 19</A>),

 and therefore Christ, having made himself a curse for us, submitted to 
 it. <I>Secondly,</I> That he was a <I>poor man,</I> else he might have 
 travelled on horseback or in a chariot. To this instance of meanness 
 and mortification he humbled himself for us, that he went all his 
 journeys on foot. When <I>servants</I> were on <I>horses, princes 
 walked as servants on the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:7">Eccl. x. 7</A>.

 When we are carried easily, let us think on the weariness of our
 Master. <I>Thirdly,</I> It should seem that he was but a <I>tender 
 man,</I> and not of a robust constitution; it should seem, his 
 disciples were not tired, for they went into the town without any 
 difficulty, when their Master sat down, and could not go a step 
 further. Bodies of the finest mould are most sensible of fatigue, and 
 can worst bear it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] We have him here betaking himself to the common relief of 
 travellers; <I>Being wearied, he sat thus on the well. First,</I> He 
 sat <I>on the well,</I> an <I>uneasy place,</I> cold and hard; he had 
 no couch, no easy chair to repose himself in, but took to that which 
 was <I>next hand,</I> to teach us not to be nice and curious in the 
 conveniences of this life, but content with <I>mean things. 
 Secondly,</I> He sat <I>thus,</I> in an <I>uneasy posture;</I> sat 
 <I>carelessly--incuriose et neglectim;</I> or he sat <I>so</I> as people
 that are wearied with travelling are accustomed to sit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His discourse with a Samaritan woman, which is here recorded at 
 large, while Christ's dispute with the doctors, and his discourse with 
 Moses and Elias on the mount, are buried in silence. This discourse is 
 reducible to four heads:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They discourse <I>concerning the water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:7-15"><I>v.</I> 7-15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Notice is taken of the <I>circumstances</I> that gave occasion to 
 this discourse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] There comes a <I>woman</I> of Samaria to <I>draw water.</I> This 
 intimates her poverty, she had no servant to be a <I>drawer of 
 water;</I> and her industry, she would do it herself. See here, 
 <I>First,</I> How God owns and approves of honest humble diligence in 
 our places. Christ was made known to the shepherds when they were 
 keeping their flock. <I>Secondly,</I> How the divine Providence brings 
 about glorious purposes by events which seem to us fortuitous and 
 accidental. This woman's meeting with Christ at the well may remind us 
 of the stories of Rebekah, Rachel, and Jethro's daughter, who all met 
 with husbands, good husbands, no worse than Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, 
 when they came to the wells for water. <I>Thirdly,</I> How the 
 preventing grace of God sometimes brings people unexpectedly under the 
 means of conversion and salvation. He is found of them that sought him 
 not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] His disciples were <I>gone away into the city to buy meat.</I> 
 Hence learn a lesson, <I>First,</I> Of justice and honesty. The meat 
 Christ ate, he bought and paid for, as Paul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:8">2 Thess. iii. 8</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Of daily dependence upon Providence: <I>Take no
 thought for the morrow.</I> Christ did not go into the city to eat, but 
 sent his disciples to fetch his meat thither; not because he scrupled 
 eating in a Samaritan city, but, 

 1. Because he had a good work to do at that well, which might be done 
 while they were catering. It is wisdom to fill up our vacant minutes 
 with that which is good, that the <I>fragments</I> of time may <I>not 
 be lost.</I> Peter, while his dinner was getting ready, fell into a 
 trance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:10">Acts x. 10</A>.

 2. Because it was more private and retired, more cheap and homely, to
 have his dinner brought him hither, than to go into the town for it. 
 Perhaps his purse was low, and he would teach us <I>good husbandry,</I> 
 to <I>spend</I> according to what we <I>have</I> and not go beyond it. 
 At least, he would teach us not to affect great things. Christ could 
 eat his dinner as well upon a <I>draw well</I> as in the best inn in 
 the town. Let us <I>comport</I> with our circumstances. Now this gave 
 Christ an opportunity of discoursing with this woman about spiritual 
 concerns, and he improved it; he often preached to multitudes that 
 crowded after him for instruction, yet here he condescends to teach a 
 single person, a woman, a poor woman, a stranger, a Samaritan, to teach 
 his ministers to do likewise, as those that know what a glorious 
 achievement it is to help to save, though but <I>one soul,</I> from 
 death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Let us observe the <I>particulars</I> of this discourse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Jesus begins with a modest request for a draught of water: <I>Give 
 me to drink.</I> He that <I>for our sakes became poor</I> here becomes 
 a beggar, that those who are in want, and cannot dig, may not be 
 ashamed to beg. Christ asked for it, not only because he needed it, and 
 needed her help to come at it, but because he would draw on further 
 discourse with her, and teach us to be willing to be beholden to the 
 meanest when there is occasion. Christ is still begging in his poor 
 members, and a <I>cup of cold water,</I> like this here, given to them 
 in his name, shall not lose its reward.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The woman, though she does not deny his request, yet quarrels with 
 him because he did not carry on the humour of his own nation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>How is it?</I> Observe, <I>First,</I> What a mortal feud there was 
 between the Jews and the Samaritans: <I>The Jews have no dealings with 
 the Samaritans.</I> The Samaritans were the <I>adversaries of Judah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:1">Ezra iv. 1</A>),

 were upon all occasions mischievous to them. The Jews were extremely 
 malicious against the Samaritans, "looked upon them as having no part 
 in the resurrection, excommunicated and cursed them by the sacred name 
 of God, by the glorious writing of the tables, and by the curse of the 
 upper and lower house of judgment, with this law, That no Israelite eat 
 of any thing that is a Samaritan's, for it is as if he should eat 
 swine's flesh." So Dr. Lightfoot, out of <I>Rabbi Tanchum.</I> Note, 
 Quarrels about religion are usually the most implacable of all 
 quarrels. Men were made to <I>have dealing</I> one with another; but if 
 men, because one worships at one temple and another at another, will 
 deny the offices of humanity, and charity, and common civility, will be 
 morose and unnatural, scornful and censorious, and this under colour of 
 zeal for religion, they plainly show that however their religion may be 
 <I>true</I> they are not <I>truly religious;</I> but, pretending to 
 stickle for religion, subvert the design of it. <I>Secondly,</I> How 
 ready the woman was to upbraid Christ with the haughtiness and ill 
 nature of the Jewish nation: <I>How is it that thou, being a Jew, 
 askest drink of me?</I> By his dress or dialect, or both, she knew him 
 to be a Jew, and <I>thinks it strange</I> that he runs not to the same 
 excess of riot against the Samaritans with other Jews. Note, Moderate 
 men of all sides are, like Joshua and his fellows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:8">Zech. iii. 8</A>),

 <I>men wondered at.</I> Two things this woman wonders at, 

 1. That he should <I>ask</I> this kindness; for it was the pride of the 
 Jews that they would endure any hardship rather than be beholden to a 
 Samaritan. It was part of Christ's humiliation that he was born of the
 Jewish nation, which was <I>now</I> not only in an <I>ill state,</I> 
 subject to the Romans, but in an <I>ill name</I> among the nations. 
 With what disdain did Pilate ask, <I>Am I a Jew?</I> Thus he <I>made 
 himself</I> not only <I>of no reputation,</I> but of <I>ill 
 reputation;</I> but herein he has set us an example of swimming against 
 the stream of common corruptions. We must, like our master, put on 
 <I>goodness</I> and <I>kindness,</I> though it should be ever so much 
 the genius of our country, or the humour of our party, to be morose and 
 ill-natured. This woman expected that Christ should be as other Jews 
 were; but it is unjust to charge upon every individual person even the 
 common faults of the community: no rule but has some exceptions. 

 2. She wonders that he should <I>expect to receive</I> this kindness
 from her that was a Samaritan: "You Jews could deny it to one of our 
 nation, and why should we grant it to one of yours?" Thus quarrels are 
 propagated endlessly by revenge and retaliation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Christ takes this occasion to instruct her in divine things: <I>If 
 thou knewest the gift of God, thou wouldst have asked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He waives her objection of the feud between the Jews and 
 Samaritans, and takes no notice of it. Some differences are best 
 <I>healed</I> by being <I>slighted,</I> and by avoiding all occasions 
 of <I>entering into dispute</I> about them. Christ will convert this
 woman, not by showing her that the Samaritan worship was 
 <I>schismatical</I> (though really it was so), but by showing her her 
 own ignorance and immoralities, and her need of a Saviour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He fills her with an apprehension that she had now an 
 opportunity (a fairer opportunity than she was aware of) of gaining 
 that which would be of unspeakable advantage to her. She had not the 
 helps that the Jews had to discern the signs of the times, and 
 therefore Christ tells her expressly that she had now a season of 
 grace; this was <I>the day of her visitation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> He hints to her what she <I>should know,</I> but was ignorant 
 of: <I>If thou knewest the gift of God,</I> that is, as the next words 
 explain it, <I>who it is that saith, Give me to drink.</I> If thou 
 knewest <I>who I am.</I> She saw him to be a Jew, a poor weary 
 traveller; but he would have her know something more concerning him 
 that did yet appear. Note,

 (<I>a.</I>) Jesus Christ is the <I>gift of God,</I> the richest token 
 of God's love to us, and the richest treasure of all good for us; <I>a 
 gift,</I> not a debt which we could demand from God; not a <I>loan,</I> 
 which he will demand from us again, but a gift, a free gift,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:16"><I>ch.</I> iii. 16</A>.

 (<I>b.</I>) It is an unspeakable privilege to have this gift of God
 proposed and offered to us; to have an opportunity of embracing it: "He 
 who is the gift of God is now set before thee, and addresses himself to 
 <I>thee;</I> it is he that saith, <I>Give me to drink;</I> this gift 
 comes a begging to thee." 

 (<I>c.</I>) Though Christ is set before us, and sues to us in and by 
 his gospel, yet there are multitudes that <I>know him not.</I> They 
 know not who it is that speaks to them in the gospel, that saith, 
 <I>Give me to drink;</I> they perceive not that it is the Lord that 
 calls them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> He hopes concerning her, what she would have done if she had 
 known him; to be sure she would not have given him such a rude and 
 uncivil answer; nay, she would have been so far from affronting him 
 that she would have made her addresses to him: <I>Thou wouldest have 
 asked.</I> Note, 

 (<I>a.</I>) Those that would have any benefit by Christ must ask for 
 it, must be earnest in prayer to God for it.

 (<I>b.</I>) Those that have a right knowledge of Christ will seek to 
 him, and if we do not seek unto him it is a sign that we do not know 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:10">Ps. ix. 10</A>.

 (<I>c.</I>) Christ knows what they that want the means of knowledge
 would have done if they had had them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:21">Matt. xi. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>c.</I> He assures her what he would have done for her if she had 
 applied to him: "He <I>would have given thee</I> (and not have 
 upbraided thee as thou doest me) <I>living water.</I>" By this living 
 water is meant the <I>Spirit,</I> who is not like the water in the 
 bottom of the well, for some of which he asked, but like <I>living</I> 
 or <I>running</I> water, which was much more valuable. Note, 
 
 (<I>a.</I>) The Spirit of grace is as <I>living water;</I> see 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38"><I>ch.</I> vii. 38</A>.

 Under this similitude the blessings of the Messiah had been promised in
 the Old Testament, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:3,35:7,44:4,55:1,Zec+14:8">Isa. xii. 3; xxxv. 7; xliv. 3; lv. 1;
 Zech. xiv. 8</A>.

 The graces of the Spirit, and his comforts, satisfy the thirsting soul, 
 that knows its own nature and necessity.

 (<I>b.</I>) Jesus Christ <I>can</I> and <I>will</I> give the Holy
 Spirit to them that ask him; for he <I>received</I> that he might 
 <I>give.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] The woman objects against and cavils at the gracious intimation 
 which Christ gave her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 <I>Thou hast nothing to draw with;</I> and besides, <I>Art thou greater 
 than our father Jacob?</I> What he spoke figuratively, she took 
 literally; Nicodemus did so too. See what confused notions they have
 of spiritual things who are wholly taken up with the things that are 
 sensible. Some respect she pays to this person, in calling him 
 <I>Sir,</I> or <I>Lord;</I> but little respect to what he said, which 
 she does but banter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> She does not think him capable of furnishing her with any 
 water, no, not this in the well that is just at hand: <I>Thou has 
 nothing to draw with,</I> and <I>the well is deep.</I> This she said, 
 not knowing the power of Christ, for he who <I>causeth the vapours</I> 
 to ascend from the ends of the earth needs <I>nothing to draw.</I> But 
 there are those who will trust Christ no further than they can see him, 
 and will not believe his promise, unless the means of the performance 
 of it be <I>visible;</I> as if he were tied to our methods, and could 
 not draw water without our buckets. She asks scornfully, "<I>Whence 
 hast thou this living water?</I> I see not whence thou canst have it." 
 Note, The springs of that living water which Christ has for those that 
 come to him are secret and undiscovered. The fountain of life is hid 
 with Christ. Christ has enough for us, though we see not whence he has 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> She does not think it possible that he should furnish 
 her with any better water than this which she could come at, but he 
 could not: <I>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the 
 well?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> We will suppose the tradition true, that Jacob <I>himself, 
 and his children, and cattle, did drink of this well.</I> And we may 
 observe from it,

 (<I>a.</I>) The power and providence of God, in the continuance of the 
 fountains of water from generation to generation, by the constant 
 circulation of the rivers, like the blood in the body 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:7">Eccl. i. 7</A>),

 to which circulation perhaps the flux and reflux of the sea, like the 
 pulses of the heart, contribute. 

 (<I>b.</I>) The plainness of the patriarch Jacob; his drink was water, 
 and he and his children drank of the same well with his cattle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Yet, allowing that to be true, she was out in several things; 
 as, 

 (<I>a.</I>) In calling Jacob <I>father.</I> What authority had the 
 Samaritans to reckon themselves of the seed of Jacob? They were 
 descended from that mixed multitude which the king of Assyria had 
 placed in the cities of Samaria; what have they to do then with Jacob?
 Because they were the <I>invaders</I> of Israel's rights, and the 
 unjust possessors of Israel's lands, were they therefore the 
 <I>inheritors</I> of Israel's blood and honour? How absurd were those 
 pretensions! 

 (<I>b.</I>) She is out in claiming this well as Jacob's gift, whereas 
 he did no more give it than Moses gave the <I>manna,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:32"><I>ch.</I> vi. 32</A>.

 But thus we are apt to call the <I>messengers</I> of God's gifts the
 <I>donors</I> of them, and to look so much at the hands they <I>pass 
 through</I> as to forget the hand they <I>come from.</I> Jacob gave it 
 to his sons, not to <I>them.</I> Yet thus the church's enemies not only 
 <I>usurp,</I> but monopolize, the church's privileges.

 (<I>c.</I>) She was out in speaking of Christ as not worthy to be 
 compared with our father Jacob. An over-fond veneration for antiquity 
 makes God's graces, in the good people of our own day, to be 
 slighted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] Christ answers this cavil, and makes it out that the <I>living 
 water</I> he had to give was far better than that of Jacob's well, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Though she spoke perversely, Christ did not cast her off, but 
 instructed and encouraged her. He shows her,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> That the water of Jacob's well yielded but a 
 <I>transient</I> satisfaction and supply: "<I>Whoso drinketh of this 
 water shall thirst again.</I> It is no better than other water; it will 
 quench the present thirst, but the thirst will return, and in a few 
 hours a man will have as much <I>need,</I> and as much <I>desire,</I> 
 of water as ever he had." This intimates, 

 1. The <I>infirmities</I> of our bodies in this present state; they are 
 still <I>necessitous,</I> and ever <I>craving.</I> Life is a 
 <I>fire,</I> a <I>lamp,</I> which will soon go out, without continual 
 supplies of fuel and oil. The natural heat preys upon itself. 

 2. The <I>imperfections</I> of all our comforts in this world; they are
 not lasting, nor our satisfaction in them remaining. Whatever waters of 
 comfort we drink of, we shall <I>thirst again.</I> Yesterday's meat and 
 drink will not do to-day's work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> That the living waters he would give should yield a 
 lasting satisfaction and bliss, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Christ's gifts appear most valuable when they come to be compared with 
 the things of this world; for there will appear no comparison between 
 them. Whoever partakes of the Spirit of grace, and the comforts of the 
 everlasting gospel,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> He shall <I>never thirst,</I> he shall never want that which 
 will abundantly satisfy his soul's desires; they are <I>longing,</I> 
 but not <I>languishing.</I> A <I>desiring</I> thirst he has, nothing 
 more <I>than</I> God, still more and more <I>of</I> God; but not a 
 <I>despairing</I> thirst.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Therefore he shall never thirst, because this water that 
 Christ gives <I>shall be in him a well of water. He</I> can never be 
 reduced to extremity that has in himself a <I>fountain</I> of supply 
 and satisfaction. 

 (<I>a.</I>) <I>Ever ready,</I> for it shall be <I>in him.</I> The 
 principle of grace planted <I>in him</I> is the spring of his comfort; 
 see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38"><I>ch.</I> vii. 38</A>.

 A good man is <I>satisfied from himself,</I> for Christ <I>dwells in
 his heart.</I> The anointing abides in him; he needs not sneak to the 
 world for comfort; the <I>work</I> and the <I>witness</I> of the Spirit 
 in the heart furnish him with a firm foundation of hope and an 
 overflowing fountain of joy. 

 (<I>b.</I>) <I>Never failing,</I> for it shall be in him a <I>well of 
 water.</I> He that has at hand only a bucket of water needs not thirst 
 as long as this lasts, but it will soon be <I>exhausted;</I> but 
 believers have in them a <I>well of water,</I> overflowing, ever 
 flowing. The <I>principles</I> and <I>affections</I> which Christ's 
 holy religion <I>forms</I> in the souls of those that are brought under 
 the power of it are this <I>well of water.</I>

 [<I>a.</I>] It is <I>springing up,</I> ever in motion, which bespeaks 
 the actings of grace strong and vigorous. If good truths 
 <I>stagnate</I> in our souls, like standing water, they do not answer 
 the end of our receiving them. If there be a good treasure in the 
 heart, we must thence bring forth good things.

 [<I>b.</I>] It is springing up <I>unto everlasting life;</I> which 
 intimates, <I>First,</I> The <I>aims</I> of gracious actings. A 
 sanctified soul has its eye upon heaven, means this, designs this, does 
 all for this, will take up with nothing short of this. Spiritual life 
 springs up towards its own perfection in eternal life.
 <I>Secondly,</I> The <I>constancy</I> of those actings; it will 
 continue springing up till it come to perfection. <I>Thirdly,</I> The 
 crown of them, eternal life at last. The living water rises <I>from</I> 
 heaven, and therefore rises <I>towards</I> heaven; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:7">Eccl. i. 7</A>.

 And now is not this water better than that of Jacob's well?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [6.] The woman (whether in jest or earnest is hard to say) begs of him 
 to give her some of this water 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Give me this water, that I thirst not. First,</I> Some think that 
 she speaks <I>tauntingly,</I> and ridicules what Christ had said as 
 mere stuff; and, in derision of it, not <I>desires,</I> but 
 <I>challenges</I> him to give her some of this water: "A rare 
 invention; it will save me a great deal of <I>pains</I> if I never 
 <I>come hither to draw.</I>" But, <I>Secondly,</I> Others think that it 
 was a <I>well-meant</I> but weak and ignorant desire. She apprehended 
 that he meant something very good and useful, and therefore saith 
 <I>Amen,</I> at a venture. <I>Whatever it be,</I> let me have it; 
 <I>who will show me any good? Ease,</I> or saving of labour, is a 
 valuable good to poor labouring people. Note, 

 1. Even those that are weak and ignorant may yet have some faint and 
 fluctuating desires towards Christ and his gifts, and some good wishes 
 of grace and glory.

 2. Carnal hearts, in their best wishes, look no higher than carnal
 ends. "Give it to me," saith she, "not that I may have everlasting 
 life" (which Christ proposed), "but that I <I>come not hither to 
 draw.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The next subject of discourse with this woman in <I>concerning her 
 husband,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.

 It was not to let fall the discourse of the water of life that Christ 
 started this, as many who will bring in any <I>impertinence</I> in 
 conversation that they may drop a serious subject; but it was with a 
 gracious design that Christ mentioned it. What he had said concerning
 his grace and eternal life he found had made little impression upon 
 her, because she had not been convinced of sin: therefore, waiving the 
 discourse about the living water, he sets himself to awaken her 
 conscience, to open the wound of guilt, and then she would more easily 
 apprehend the remedy by grace. And this is the method of dealing with 
 souls; they must first be made <I>weary</I> and <I>heavy-laden</I> 
 under the burden of sin, and then brought to Christ for rest; first 
 pricked to the heart, and then healed. This is the course of spiritual 
 physic; and if we proceed not in this order we begin at the wrong 
 end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 (1.) How discreetly and decently Christ introduces this discourse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</I> Now,

 [1.] The order Christ gave her had a <I>very good colour: "Call thy 
 husband,</I> that he may teach thee, and help thee to understand these 
 things, which thou art so ignorant of" The wives that will learn must 
 <I>ask their husbands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:35">1 Cor. xiv. 35</A>),

 who must dwell with them <I>as men of knowledge,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:7">1 Pet. iii. 7</A>.
 
 "<I>Call thy husband,</I> that he may learn with thee; that then you 
 may be <I>heirs together of the grace of life. Call thy husband,</I> 
 that he may be witness to what passes between us." Christ would thus 
 teach us to <I>provide things honest in the sight of all men,</I> and 
 to study that which is of good report.

 [2.] As it had a good colour, so it had a <I>good design;</I> for hence 
 he would take occasion to call her sin to remembrance. There is need of 
 art and prudence in giving reproofs; to fetch a compass, as the woman 
 of Tekoa, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:20">2 Sam. xiv. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How industriously the woman seeks to evade the conviction, and yet 
 insensibly convicts herself, and, ere she is aware, owns her fault; she 
 said, <I>I have no husband.</I> Her saying this intimated no more than 
 that she did not care to have her husband spoken of, nor that matter 
 mentioned any more. She would not have her husband come thither, lest, 
 in further discourse, the truth of the matter should come out, to her 
 shame; and therefore, "Pray go on to talk of something else, <I>I have 
 no husband;</I>" she would be thought a <I>maid</I> or a <I>widow,</I> 
 whereas, though she had no husband, she was neither. The carnal mind is 
 very ingenious to <I>shift off</I> convictions, and to keep them from 
 fastening, careful to <I>cover the sin.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) How closely our Lord Jesus brings home the conviction to her 
 conscience. It is probable that he said more than is here recorded, for 
 she thought that he told her all that ever she did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 but that which is here recorded is concerning her husbands. Here is,

 [1.] A <I>surprising narrative</I> of her <I>past</I> conversation: 
 <I>Thou has had five husbands.</I> Doubtless, it was not her 
 <I>affliction</I> (the burying of so many husbands), but her 
 <I>sin,</I> that Christ intended to upbraid her with; either she had 
 <I>eloped</I> (as the law speaks), had run away from her 
 <I>husbands,</I> and married others, or by her undutiful, unclean, 
 disloyal conduct, had provoked them to <I>divorce her,</I> or by 
 indirect means had, contrary to law, <I>divorced them.</I> Those who 
 make light of such scandalous practices as these, as no more than 
 <I>nine days' wonder,</I> and as if the guilt were over as soon as the 
 talk is over, should remember that Christ keeps account of all. 

 [2.] A severe reproof of her present state of life: <I>He whom thou now 
 hast is not thy husband.</I> Either she was never married to him at 
 all, or he had some other wife, or, which is most probable, her former 
 husband or husbands were living: so that, in short, <I>she lived in 
 adultery.</I> Yet observe how mildly Christ tells her of it; he doth 
 not call her <I>strumpet,</I> but tells her, <I>He with whom thou 
 livest is not thy husband:</I> and then leaves it to her own conscience 
 to say the rest. Note, Reproofs are ordinarily <I>most profitable</I> 
 when they are <I>least provoking.</I> 

 [3.] Yet in this he puts a better construction than it would well bear 
 upon what she said by way of shuffle and evasion: <I>Thou has well said 
 I have no husband;</I> and again, <I>In that saidst thou truly.</I> 
 What she intended as a <I>denial of the fact</I> (that she had none 
 with whom she lived as a husband) he favourably interpreted, or at 
 least turned upon her, as a <I>confession of the fault.</I> Note, Those 
 who would win souls should <I>make the best</I> of them, whereby they 
 may hope to <I>work</I> upon their <I>good-nature;</I> for, if they 
 <I>make the worst</I> of them, they certainly <I>exasperate</I> their 
 <I>ill-nature.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The next subject of discourse with this woman is concerning <I>the 
 place of worship,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:19-24"><I>v.</I> 19-24</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A case of conscience proposed to Christ by the woman, concerning 
 the place of worship, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The inducement she had to put this case: <I>Sir, I perceive that 
 thou art a prophet.</I> She does not deny the truth of what he had 
 charged her with, but by her silence owns the justice of the reproof; 
 nor is she put into a passion by it, as many are when they are touched 
 in a sore place, does not impute his censure to the general disgust the 
 Jews had to the Samaritans, but (which is a rare thing) can bear to be 
 told of a fault. But this is not all; she goes further: <I>First,</I> 
 She speaks respectfully to him, calls him <I>Sir.</I> Thus should we 
 <I>honour</I> those that deal faithfully with us. This was the effect 
 of Christ's meekness in reproving her; he gave her no ill language, and 
 then she gave him none. <I>Secondly,</I> She acknowledges him to be a 
 <I>prophet,</I> one that had a correspondence with Heaven. Note, The 
 power of the word of Christ in searching the heart, and convincing the 
 conscience of secret sins, is a great proof of its divine authority, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:24,25">1 Cor. xiv. 24, 25</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> She desires some further instruction from him. Many
 that are not <I>angry</I> at their reprovers, nor fly in their faces, 
 yet are <I>afraid</I> of them and keep out of their way; but this woman 
 was willing to have some more discourse with him that told her of her 
 faults.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The case itself that she propounded concerning the <I>place of 
 religious worship in public.</I> Some think that she started this to 
 shift off further discourse concerning her sin. Controversies in 
 religion often prove great prejudices to serious godliness; but, it 
 should seem, she proposed it with a good design; she knew she must 
 worship God, and desired to do it aright; and therefore, meeting with a 
 prophet, begs his direction. Note, It is our wisdom to improve all 
 opportunities of getting knowledge in the things of God. When we are in 
 company with those that are <I>fit to teach,</I> let us be <I>forward 
 to learn,</I> and have a <I>good question</I> ready to put to those who 
 are able to give a <I>good answer.</I> It was agreed between the Jews 
 and the Samaritans that God is to be worshipped (even those who were 
 such fools as to worship <I>false</I> gods were not such brutes as to 
 worship none), and that religious worship is an affair of great 
 importance: men would not <I>contend</I> about it if they were not 
 <I>concerned</I> about it. But the matter in variance was <I>where</I> 
 they should worship God. Observe how she states the case:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> As for the Samaritans: <I>Our fathers worshipped in this 
 mountain,</I> near to this city and this well; there the Samaritan 
 temple was built by Sanballat, in favour of which she insinuates, 

 1. That whatever the temple was the place was holy; it was mount
 <I>Gerizim,</I> the mount in which the blessings were pronounced; and 
 some think the same on which Abraham built his altar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:6,7">Gen. xii. 6, 7</A>),
 
 and Jacob his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:18-20">Gen. xxxiii. 18-20</A>.

 2. That it might plead prescription: <I>Our fathers</I> worshipped 
 here. She thinks they have antiquity, tradition, and succession, on 
 their side. A <I>vain conversation</I> often supports itself with this, 
 that it was <I>received by tradition from our fathers.</I> But she had 
 little reason to boast of <I>their fathers;</I> for, when Antiochus 
 persecuted the Jews, the Samaritans, for fear of sharing with them in 
 their sufferings, not only renounced all relation to the Jews, but 
 surrendered their temple to Antiochus, with a request that it might be 
 dedicated to Jupiter Olympius, and called by his name. Joseph. 
 <I>Antiq.</I> 12. 257-264.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> As to the Jews: <I>You say</I> that <I>in Jerusalem is 
 the place where men ought to worship.</I> The Samaritans governed 
 themselves by the five books of Moses, and (some think) received 
 <I>only them</I> as canonical. Now, though they found frequent mention 
 there of the place God would choose, yet they did not find it named 
 there; and they saw the temple at Jerusalem stripped of many of its 
 ancient glories, and therefore thought themselves at liberty to set up 
 another place, altar against altar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ's answer to this case of conscience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>,

 &c. Those that apply themselves to Christ for instruction shall find
 him <I>meek, to teach the meek his way.</I> Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He puts <I>a slight</I> upon the question, as she had proposed it, 
 concerning the place of worship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>Woman, believe me</I> as a prophet, and mark what I say. Thou art 
 expecting the <I>hour to come</I> when either by some divine 
 revelation, or some signal providence, this matter shall be decided in 
 favour either of Jerusalem or of Mount Gerizim; but I tell thee the 
 hour is at hand when it shall be no more a question; that which thou 
 has been taught to lay so much weight on shall be set aside as a thing 
 <I>indifferent.</I>" Note, It should cool us in our contests to think 
 that those things which now fill us, and which we make such a noise 
 about, shall shortly <I>vanish,</I> and be <I>no more:</I> the very 
 things we are striving about are passing away: <I>The hour comes when 
 you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the 
 Father. First,</I> The object of worship is supposed to continue still 
 the same--<I>God,</I> as a Father; under this notion the very heathen 
 worshipped God, the Jews did so, and probably the Samaritans. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> But a period shall be put to all niceness and all 
 differences about the place of worship. The approaching dissolution of 
 the Jewish economy, and the erecting of the evangelical state, shall 
 set this matter <I>at large,</I> and lay all <I>in common,</I> so that 
 it shall be a thing perfectly indifferent whether in either of these 
 places or any other men worship God, for they shall not be tied to any 
 place; neither <I>here</I> nor <I>there,</I> but <I>both,</I> and 
 <I>any where,</I> and <I>every where.</I> Note, The worship of God is 
 not now, under the gospel, appropriated to any place, as it was under 
 the law, but it is God's will that men pray every where. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:8,Mal+1:11">1 Tim. ii. 8; Mal. i. 11</A>.

 Our reason teaches us to consult <I>decency</I> and <I>convenience</I>
 in the places of our worship: but our religion gives no preference to 
 one place above another, in respect to holiness and acceptableness to 
 God. Those who prefer any worship merely for the sake of the house or 
 building in which it is performed (though it were as magnificent and as 
 <I>solemnly</I> consecrated as ever Solomon's temple was) forget that 
 the <I>hour is come</I> when there shall be no difference put in God's 
 account: no, not between Jerusalem, which <I>had been</I> so famous for 
 sanctity, and the mountain of Samaria, which <I>had been</I> so 
 infamous for impiety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He <I>lays a stress</I> upon other things, in the matter of 
 religious worship. When he made so light of the place of worship he did 
 not intend to lessen our concern about the thing itself, of which 
 therefore he takes occasion to discourse more fully.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> As to the present state of the controversy, he 
 <I>determines</I> against the Samaritan worship, and in favour of the 
 Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 He tells here, 

 1. That the Samaritans were certainly <I>in the wrong;</I> not merely 
 because they worshipped in this mountain, though, while Jerusalem's 
 choice was in force, that was sinful, but because they were out in the 
 object of their worship. If the worship itself had been as it should 
 have been, its separation from Jerusalem might have been connived at, 
 as the <I>high places</I> were in the best reigns: <I>But you worship 
 you know not what,</I> or <I>that which you do not know.</I> They 
 worshipped the God of Israel, the true God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:2,2Ki+17:32">Ezra iv. 2; 2 Kings xvii. 32</A>);

 but they were sunk into gross ignorance; they worshipped him as the 
 <I>God of that land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:27,33">2 Kings xvii. 27, 33</A>),

 as a local deity, like the gods of the nations, whereas God must be 
 served <I>as God,</I> as the universal cause and Lord. Note, Ignorance 
 is so far from being the <I>mother</I> of devotion that it is the 
 <I>murderer</I> of it. Those that worship God <I>ignorantly</I> offer 
 the <I>blind for sacrifice,</I> and it is the <I>sacrifice of 
 fools.</I> 
 
 2. That the Jews were certainly <I>in the right.</I> For,
 
 (1.) "<I>We know what we worship.</I> We go upon sure grounds in our 
 worship, for our people are catechised and trained up in the knowledge 
 of God, as he has revealed himself in the scripture." Note, Those who 
 by the scriptures have obtained some knowledge of God (a <I>certain</I> 
 though not a <I>perfect</I> knowledge) may worship him 
 <I>comfortably</I> to themselves, and <I>acceptably</I> to him, for 
 they <I>know what they worship.</I> Christ elsewhere condemns the 
 corruptions of the Jews' worship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:9">Matt. xv. 9</A>),

 and yet here defends the worship itself; the worship may be <I>true</I> 
 where yet it is not <I>pure</I> and <I>entire.</I> Observe, Our Lord 
 Jesus was pleased to reckon himself among the <I>worshippers</I> of 
 God: <I>We worship. Though he was a Son</I> (and then are the children
 free), <I>yet learned he this obedience,</I> in the days of his 
 humiliation. Let not the greatest of men think the worship of God below 
 them, when the Son of God himself did not. 

 (2.) <I>Salvation is of the Jews;</I> and therefore they know what they 
 worship, and what grounds they go upon in their worship. Not that all 
 the Jews were saved, nor that it was not possible but that many of the 
 Gentiles and Samaritans might be saved, for in <I>every nation</I> he 
 that fears God and works righteousness is <I>accepted of him;</I> but,

 [1.] The author of eternal salvation comes of the Jews, appears among 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:5">Rom. ix. 5</A>),

 and is sent first to <I>bless</I> them.

 [2.] The means of eternal salvation are afforded to them. The <I>word 
 of salvation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:26">Acts xiii. 26</A>)

 was <I>of the Jews.</I> It was delivered to them, and other nations 
 derived it through them. This was a sure guide to them in their
 devotions, and they followed it, and therefore knew what they 
 worshipped. To them were committed the <I>oracles of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:2">Rom. iii. 2</A>),
 
 and the <I>service of God,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>).

 The Jews therefore being thus privileged and advanced, it was 
 presumption for the Samaritans to vie with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He describes the evangelical worship which alone God 
 would accept and be well pleased with. Having shown that the place is 
 <I>indifferent,</I> he comes to show what is <I>necessary</I> and 
 <I>essential</I>--that we worship God <I>in spirit and in truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 The stress is not to be laid upon the <I>place</I> where we worship 
 God, but upon the state of <I>mind</I> in which we worship him. Note,
 The most effectual way to take up differences in the minor matters of 
 religion is to be more zealous in the greater. Those who daily make it 
 the matter of their care to worship <I>in the spirit,</I> one would 
 think, should not make it the matter of their strife whether he should 
 be worshipped here or there. Christ had justly preferred the Jewish 
 worship before the Samaritan, yet here he intimates the imperfection of 
 that. The worship was <I>ceremonial,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:1,10">Heb. ix. 1, 10</A>.

 The worshippers were generally <I>carnal,</I> and strangers to the
 <I>inward part</I> of divine worship. Note, It is possible that we may 
 be better than our neighbours, and yet not so good as we should be. It 
 concerns us to be right, not only in the <I>object</I> of our worship, 
 but in the <I>manner</I> of it; and it is this which Christ here 
 instructs us in. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> The great and glorious revolution which should introduce this 
 change: <I>The hour cometh, and now is</I>--the fixed stated time,
 concerning which it was of old determined when it should come, and how 
 long it should last. The time of its <I>appearance</I> if <I>fixed</I> 
 to an hour, so punctual and exact are the divine counsels; the time of 
 its <I>continuance</I> is <I>limited</I> to an hour, so close and 
 pressing is the opportunity of divine grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:2">2 Cor. vi. 2</A>.

 This hour <I>cometh,</I> it is coming in its full strength, lustre, and
 perfection, it <I>now is</I> in the embryo and infancy. The <I>perfect 
 day is coming,</I> and now it <I>dawns.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> The blessed change itself. In gospel times the <I>true 
 worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.</I> As 
 creatures, we worship the Father of <I>all:</I> as Christians, we 
 worship <I>the Father of our Lord Jesus.</I> Now the change shall be,

 (<I>a.</I>) In the <I>nature</I> of the worship. Christians shall 
 worship God, not in the ceremonial observances of the Mosaic 
 institution, but in <I>spiritual</I> ordinances, consisting less in 
 <I>bodily exercise,</I> and animated and invigorated more with divine 
 power and energy. The way of worship which Christ has instituted is 
 rational and intellectual, and refined from those external rites and 
 ceremonies with which the Old-Testament worship was both clouded and 
 clogged. This is called true worship, in opposition to that which was 
 typical. The legal services were <I>figures of the true,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:3,24">Heb. ix. 3, 24</A>.

 Those that revolted from Christianity to Judaism are said to <I>begin
 in the spirit, and end in the flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:3">Gal. iii. 3</A>.

 Such was the difference between Old-Testament and New-Testament 
 institutions.

 (<I>b.</I>) In the <I>temper</I> and <I>disposition</I> of the
 worshippers; and so the true worshippers are good Christians, 
 distinguished from hypocrites; all <I>should,</I> and they will, 
 worship God <I>in spirit and in truth.</I> It is spoken of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 as their character, and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 as their duty. Note, It is required of all that worship God that they 
 worship him <I>in spirit and in truth.</I> We must worship God,

 [<I>a.</I>] <I>In spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:3">Phil. iii. 3</A>.

 We must depend upon <I>God's Spirit</I> for strength and assistance, 
 laying our souls under his influences and operations; we must devote 
 <I>our own spirits</I> to, and employ them in, the service of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:9">Rom. i. 9</A>),

 must worship him with fixedness of thought and a flame of affection,
 with <I>all that is within us.</I> Spirit is sometimes put for the new 
 nature, in opposition to the <I>flesh,</I> which is the corrupt nature; 
 and so to worship God <I>with our spirits</I> is to worship him <I>with 
 our graces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:28">Heb. xii. 28</A>.

 [<I>b.</I>] <I>In truth,</I> that is, in <I>sincerity.</I> God requires 
 not only the <I>inward part</I> in our worship, but <I>truth in the 
 inward part,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:6">
 Ps. li. 6</A>.

 We must mind the power more than the form, must aim at God's glory, and
 not to be <I>seen of men;</I> draw near with a <I>true heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:22">Heb. x. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> He intimates the reasons why God must be thus 
 worshipped.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> Because in gospel times they, and they only, are accounted 
 the <I>true</I> worshippers. The gospel erects a spiritual way of 
 worship, so that the professors of the gospel are not true in their 
 profession, do not live up to gospel light and laws, if they do not 
 worship God <I>in spirit and in truth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Because <I>the Father seeketh such worshippers of him.</I> 
 This intimates,

 (<I>a.</I>) That such worshippers are very rare, and seldom met with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">Jer. xxx. 21</A>.

 The gate of spiritual worshipping is strait.

 (<I>b.</I>) That such worship is necessary, and what the God of heaven 
 insists upon. When God comes to <I>enquire</I> for worshippers, the 
 question will not be, "Who worshipped at Jerusalem?" but, "Who 
 worshipped in spirit?" That will be the touchstone. 

 (<I>c.</I>) That God is greatly well pleased with and graciously 
 accepts such worship and such worshippers. <I>I have desired it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:13,14,So+2:14">Ps. cxxxii. 13, 14; Cant. ii. 14</A>.

 (<I>d.</I>) That there has been, and will be to the end, a remnant of
 such worshippers; his <I>seeking</I> such worshippers implies his 
 <I>making</I> them such. God is in all ages gathering in to himself a
 generation of spiritual worshippers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>c.</I> Because <I>God is a spirit.</I> Christ came to <I>declare 
 God</I> to us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>),

 and this he has declared concerning him; he declared it to this poor
 Samaritan woman, for the meanest are concerned to know God; and with 
 this design, to rectify her mistakes concerning religious worship, to 
 which nothing would contribute more than the right knowledge of God. 
 Note, 

 (<I>a.</I>) <I>God is a spirit,</I> for he is an infinite and eternal 
 mind, an intelligent being, incorporeal, immaterial, invisible, and 
 incorruptible. It is easier to say what God is not than what he is; a 
 spirit <I>has not flesh and bones,</I> but <I>who knows the way of a 
 spirit?</I> If God were not <I>a spirit,</I> he could not be 
 <I>perfect,</I> nor infinite, nor eternal, nor independent, nor the 
 Father of spirits. 

 (<I>b.</I>) The spirituality of the divine nature is a very good reason 
 for the spirituality of divine worship. If we do not worship God, who 
 is <I>a spirit, in the spirit,</I> we neither <I>give him the glory due 
 to his name,</I> and so do not perform the <I>act</I> of worship, nor 
 can we hope to obtain his favour and acceptance, and so we miss of the 
 <I>end</I> of worship, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:8,9">Matt. xv. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The last subject of discourse with this woman is concerning the 
 Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The faith of the woman, by which she expected the Messiah: <I>I
 know that Messias cometh--and he will tell us all things.</I> She had
 nothing to object against what Christ had said; his discourse was, for 
 aught she knew, what might become the Messiah then expected; but 
 <I>from him</I> she would receive it, and in the mean time she thinks 
 it best to suspend her belief. Thus many have no heart to the price 
 <I>in their hand</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:16">Prov. xvii. 16</A>),

 because they think they have a better <I>in their eye,</I> and deceive 
 themselves with a promise that they will learn that <I>hereafter</I> 
 which they neglect <I>now.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Whom she expects: <I>I know that Messias cometh.</I> The Jews and 
 Samaritans, though so much at variance, agreed in the expectation of 
 the messiah and his kingdom. The Samaritans received the writings of 
 Moses, and were no strangers to the prophets, nor to the hopes of the 
 Jewish nation; those who knew least knew this, that Messias was to 
 come; so general and uncontested was the expectation of him, and at 
 this time more raised than ever (for the sceptre was departed from 
 Judah, Daniel's weeks were near expiring), so that she concludes not 
 only, <I>He will come,</I> but <B><I>erchetai</I></B>--"<I>He comes,</I>
 he is just at hand:" <I>Messias, who is called Christ.</I> The 
 evangelist, though he retains the Hebrew word <I>Messias</I> (which the 
 woman used) in honour to the holy language, and to the Jewish church, 
 that used it familiarly, yet, writing for the use of the Gentiles, he 
 takes care to render it by a Greek word of the same signification, 
 <I>who is called Christ-Anointed,</I> giving an example to the 
 apostle's rule, that whatever is spoken in an unknown or less vulgar 
 tongue should be <I>interpreted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:27,28">1 Cor. xiv. 27, 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What she expects from him: "<I>He will tell us all things</I> 
 relating to the service of God which it is needful for us to know, will 
 tell us that which will supply our defects, rectify our mistakes, and 
 put an end to all our disputes. He will tell us the mind of God fully 
 and clearly, and keep back nothing." Now this implies an 
 acknowledgement, <I>First,</I> Of the deficiency and imperfection of 
 the discovery they now had of the divine will, and the rule they had of 
 the divine worship; it <I>could not make the comers thereunto 
 perfect,</I> and therefore they expected some great advance and 
 improvement in matters of religion, a time of reformation. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Of the sufficiency of the Messiah to make this change: 
 "<I>He will tell us all things</I> which we want to know, and about 
 which we wrangle in the dark. He will introduce <I>peace,</I> by 
 <I>leading us into all truth,</I> and dispelling the mists of error." 
 It seems, this was the comfort of good people in those dark times that 
 light would arise; if they found themselves at a loss, and run aground, 
 it was a satisfaction to them to say, <I>When Messias comes, he will 
 tell us all things;</I> as it may be to us now with reference to his 
 second coming: now we see through a glass, but then <I>face to 
 face.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he
 talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or,
 Why talkest thou with her?
 &nbsp; 28  The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the
 city, and saith to the men,
 &nbsp; 29  Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did:
 is not this the Christ?
 &nbsp; 30  Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
 &nbsp; 31  In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master,
 eat.
 &nbsp; 32  But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not
 of.
 &nbsp; 33  Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man
 brought him <I>ought</I> to eat?
 &nbsp; 34  Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that
 sent me, and to finish his work.
 &nbsp; 35  Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <I>then</I> cometh
 harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on
 the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
 &nbsp; 36  And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit
 unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth
 may rejoice together.
 &nbsp; 37  And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another
 reapeth.
 &nbsp; 38  I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other
 men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
 &nbsp; 39  And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for
 the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that
 ever I did.
 &nbsp; 40  So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him
 that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
 &nbsp; 41  And many more believed because of his own word;
 &nbsp; 42  And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy
 saying: for we have heard <I>him</I> ourselves, and know that this is
 indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the remainder of the story of what happened when Christ 
 was in Samaria, after the long conference he had with the woman.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>interruption given to this discourse</I> by the disciples' 
 coming. It is probable that much more was said than is recorded; but 
 just when the discourse was brought to a head, when Christ had made 
 himself known to her as the true Messiah, <I>then came the 
 disciples.</I> The <I>daughters of Jerusalem</I> shall not <I>stir up 
 nor awake my love till he please.</I> 

 1. They wondered at Christ's converse with this woman, marvelled that
 he talked thus earnestly (as perhaps they observed at a distance) with 
 a woman, a strange woman alone (he used to be more <I>reserved</I>), 
 especially with a Samaritan woman, that was not of the lost sheep of 
 the house of Israel; they thought their Master should be as shy of the 
 Samaritans as the other Jews were, at least that he should not preach 
 the gospel to them. They wondered he should condescend to talk with 
 such a poor contemptible woman, forgetting what despicable men they 
 themselves were when Christ first called them into fellowship with 
 himself. 

 2. Yet they acquiesced in it; they knew it was for some good reason,
 and some good end, of which he was not bound to give them an account, 
 and therefore none of them asked, <I>What seekest thou?</I> or, <I>Why 
 talkest thou with her?</I> Thus, when particular difficulties occur in 
 the word and providence of God, it is good to satisfy ourselves with 
 this in general, that all is well which Jesus Christ saith and doeth. 
 Perhaps there was something <I>amiss</I> in their <I>marveling</I> that 
 <I>Christ talked with the woman:</I> it was something like the 
 Pharisees being offended at his eating with publicans and sinners. But, 
 whatever they <I>thought,</I> they said <I>nothing. If thou hast 
 thought evil</I> at any time, <I>lay thy hand upon thy mouth,</I> to 
 keep that evil thought from turning into an evil word,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:32,Ps+39:1-3">Prov. xxx. 32; Ps. xxxix. 1-3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The notice which the woman gave to her neighbours of the extraordinary 
 person she had happily met with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How she <I>forgot her errand to the well,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Therefore, because the disciples were come, and broke up the discourse, 
 and perhaps she observed they were not pleased with it, she <I>went her 
 way.</I> She withdrew, in civility to Christ, that he might have 
 leisure to <I>eat his dinner.</I> She delighted in his discourse, but 
 would not be <I>rude;</I> every thing is beautiful in its season. She 
 supposed that Jesus, when he had dined, would go forward in his 
 journey, and therefore hastened to tell her neighbours, that they might 
 come quickly. <I>Yet a little while is the light with you.</I> See how 
 she improved time; when one good work was done, she applied herself to 
 another. When opportunities of <I>getting good</I> cease, or are 
 interrupted, we should seek opportunities of <I>doing good;</I> when we 
 have done <I>hearing</I> the word, then is a time to be <I>speaking</I> 
 of it. Notice is taken of her <I>leaving her water-pot</I> or 
 <I>pail.</I>

 (1.) She left it in kindness to Christ, that he might have water to 
 drink; he turned water into wine for others, but not for himself. 
 Compare this with Rebecca's civility to Abraham's servant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:18">Gen. xxiv. 18</A>),
 
 and see that promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:42">Matt. x. 42</A>.

 (2.) She left it that she might make the more haste into the city, to 
 carry thither these good tidings. Those whose business it is to
 publish the name of Christ must not encumber or entangle themselves 
 with any thing that will retard or hinder them therein. When the 
 disciples are to be made fishers of men they must <I>forsake all.</I> 
 
 (3.) She left her water-pot, as one <I>careless of it,</I> being wholly 
 taken up with better things. Note, Those who are brought to the 
 knowledge of Christ will show it by a holy contempt of this world and 
 the things of it. And those who are <I>newly</I> acquainted with the 
 things of God must be <I>excused,</I> if at first they be so taken up 
 with the new world into which they are brought that the things of this 
 world seem to be for a time wholly neglected. Mr. Hildersham, in one of 
 his sermons on this verse, from this instance largely justifies those 
 who leave their worldly business on week-days to go to hear 
 sermons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How she <I>minded her errand to the town,</I> for her heart was upon 
 it. She <I>went into the city,</I> and said to <I>the men,</I> probably 
 the aldermen, the men in authority, whom, it may be, she found met 
 together upon some public business; or to <I>the men,</I> that is, to 
 every man she met in the streets; she proclaimed it in the chief places 
 of concourse: <I>Come, see a man who told me all things that ever I 
 did. Is not this the Christ?</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How <I>solicitous</I> she was to <I>have her friends and 
 neighbours</I> acquainted with Christ. When she had found that 
 treasure, she <I>called together her friends and neighbours</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:9">Luke xv. 9</A>),

 not only to <I>rejoice with her,</I> but to share with her, knowing 
 there was enough to enrich herself and all that would partake with her. 
 Note, They that have been themselves with Jesus, and have found comfort 
 in him, should do all they can to bring others to him. Has he done us
 the honour to make himself known to us? Let us do him the honour to 
 make him known to others; nor can we do ourselves a greater honour. 
 This woman becomes an apostle. <I>Qu&aelig; scortum fuerat egressa, 
 regreditur magistra evangelica--She who went forth a specimen of 
 impurity returns a teacher of evangelical truth,</I> saith 
 <I>Aretius.</I> Christ had told her to <I>call her husband,</I> which 
 she thought was warrant enough to <I>call every body.</I> She went into 
 <I>the city,</I> the city where she dwelt, among her kinsfolks and 
 acquaintance. Though every man is my neighbour that I have opportunity 
 of doing good to, yet I have most <I>opportunity,</I> and therefore lie 
 under the greatest <I>obligations,</I> to do good to those that live 
 near me. <I>Where the tree falls,</I> there let it be made useful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How fair and ingenuous she was in the notice she gave them 
 concerning this stranger she had met with. 

 [1.] She <I>tells them</I> plainly what induced her to admire him: 
 <I>He has told me all things that ever I did.</I> No more is recorded 
 than what he told her of her husbands; but it is not improbable that he 
 had told her of more of her faults. Or, his telling her that which she 
 knew he could not by any ordinary means come to the knowledge of 
 convinced her that he could have told her all that she ever did. If he 
 has a <I>divine</I> knowledge, it must be omniscience. He told her that 
 which none knew but God and her own conscience. Two things affected 
 her:--<I>First, the extent of his knowledge.</I> We ourselves cannot 
 tell <I>all things that ever we did</I> (many things pass 
 <I>unheeded,</I> and more pass away and are forgotten); but Jesus 
 Christ knows all the thoughts, words, and actions, of all the children 
 of men; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:13">Heb. iv. 13</A>.

 He hath said, <I>I know thy works. Secondly, The power of his word.</I>
 This made a great impression upon her, that he told her her <I>secret 
 sins</I> with such an unaccountable power and energy that, being told 
 of one, she is <I>convinced of all, and judged of all.</I> She does not 
 say, "Come, see a man that has told me strange things concerning 
 religious worship, and the laws of it, that has decided the controversy 
 between this mountain and Jerusalem, a man that calls himself the 
 <I>Messias;</I>" but, "<I>Come see a man</I> that has told me of my 
 sins." She fastens upon that part of Christ's discourse which one would 
 think she would have been most shy of repeating; but experimental 
 proofs of the power of Christ's word and Spirit are of all others the 
 most cogent and convincing; and that <I>knowledge of Christ</I> into 
 which we are led by the conviction of sin and humiliation is most 
 likely to be <I>sound</I> and <I>saving.</I>

 [2.] She <I>invites them</I> to <I>come and see</I> him of whom she had 
 conceived so high an opinion. Not barely, "Come and look upon him" (she 
 does not invite them to him as a <I>show</I>), but, "Come and converse 
 with him; come and <I>hear his wisdom,</I> as I have done, and you will 
 be of my mind." She would not undertake to manage the arguments which 
 had convinced her, in such a manner as to convince others; all that see 
 the evidence of truth themselves are not able to make others see it; 
 but, "Come, and talk with him, and you will find such a power in his 
 word as far exceeds all other evidence." Note, Those who can do little 
 else towards the conviction and conversion of others may and should 
 bring them to those means of grace which they themselves have found 
 effectual. Jesus was now at the town's end. "Now come see him." When 
 opportunities of getting the knowledge of God are brought to our doors 
 we are inexcusable if we neglect them; shall we not go over the 
 threshold to see him whose day prophets and kings desired to see? 

 [3.] She resolves to <I>appeal to themselves,</I> and their own 
 sentiments upon the trial. <I>Is not this the Christ?</I> She does not 
 peremptorily say, "He is the Messiah," how clear soever she was in her 
 own mind, and yet she very prudently mentions the Messiah, of whom 
 otherwise they would not have thought, and then refers it to 
 themselves; she will not impose her faith upon them, but only propose 
 it to them. By such fair but forcible appeals as these men's judgments 
 and consciences are sometimes taken hold of ere they are aware.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What success she had in this invitation: <I>They went out of the 
 city, and came to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 Though it might seem very improbable that a woman of so <I>small</I> a 
 figure, and so <I>ill</I> a character, should have the honour of the 
 first discovery of the Messiah among the Samaritans, yet it pleased God 
 to incline their hearts to take notice of her report, and not to slight 
 it as an idle tale. Time was when lepers were the first that brought 
 tidings to Samaria of a great deliverance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:3">2 Kings vii. 3</A>,

 &c. They <I>came unto him;</I> did not send for him into the city to
 them, but in token of their respect to him, and the earnestness of 
 their desire to see him, they <I>went out to him.</I> Those that would 
 know Christ must meet him where he records his name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's discourse with his disciples while the woman was absent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:31-38"><I>v.</I> 31-38</A>.

 See how industrious our Lord Jesus was to <I>redeem time,</I> to 
 husband every minute of it, and to <I>fill up</I> the vacancies of it. 
 When the disciples were gone into the town, his discourse with the 
 woman was <I>edifying,</I> and suited to her case; when she was gone 
 into the town, his discourse with them was no less edifying, and suited 
 to their case; it were well if we could <I>thus</I> gather up the 
 fragments of time, that none of it may be lost. Two things are 
 observable in this discourse:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How Christ <I>expresses the delight</I> which he himself had in his 
 work. His work was to <I>seek and save</I> that which was lost, to go 
 about doing good. Now with this work we here find him wholly taken up.
 For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>He neglected his meat and drink for his work.</I> When he sat 
 down upon the well, he was <I>weary,</I> and needed refreshment; but 
 this opportunity of saving souls made him forget his weariness and 
 hunger. And he minded <I>his food</I> so little that, 

 [1.] His disciples were forced to invite him to it: <I>They prayed 
 him,</I> they pressed him, saying, <I>Master, eat.</I> It was an 
 instance of their <I>love to him</I> that they invited him, lest he 
 should be faint and sick for want of some support; but it was a greater 
 instance of his <I>love to souls</I> that he needed invitation. Let us 
 learn hence a holy indifference even to the needful supports of life, 
 in comparison with spiritual things. 

 [2.] He minded it so little that they suspected he had had meat brought 
 him in their absence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>Has any man brought him aught to eat?</I> He had so little appetite 
 for his dinner that they were ready to think he had dined already.
 Those that make religion their business will, when any of its affairs 
 are to be attended, prefer them before their food; as Abraham's 
 servant, that would not eat till he had told his errand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:33">Gen. xxiv. 33</A>),
 
 and Samuel, that would not sit down till David was anointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:11">1 Sam. xvi. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He <I>made his work his meat and drink.</I> The work he <I>had to 
 do</I> among the Samaritans, the prospect he now had of doing good to 
 many, this was <I>meat and drink</I> to him; it was the greatest 
 pleasure and satisfaction imaginable. Never did a hungry man, or an 
 epicure, expect a plentiful feast with so much desire, nor feed upon 
 its dainties with so much delight, as our Lord Jesus expected and 
 improved an opportunity of doing good to souls. Concerning this he 
 saith, 

 [1.] That it was such <I>meat</I> as the disciples <I>knew not of.</I> 
 They did not imagine that he had any design or prospect of planting his 
 gospel among the Samaritans; this was a piece of usefulness they never 
 thought of. Note, Christ by his gospel and Spirit does more good to the 
 souls of men than his own disciples <I>know of</I> or <I>expect.</I> 
 This may be said of good Christians too, who live by faith, that they 
 have meat to eat which others know not of, joy with which a stranger 
 does not intermeddle. Now this word made them ask, <I>Has any man 
 brought him aught to eat?</I> so apt were even his own disciples to 
 understand him after a corporal and carnal manner when he used 
 similitudes. 

 [2.] That the reason why his work was his meat and drink was because it 
 was his Father's work, his Father's will: <I>My meat is to do the will 
 of him that sent me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> The salvation of sinners is the <I>will of God,</I> 
 and the instruction of them in order thereunto is <I>his work.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:4">1 Tim. ii. 4</A>.

 There is a chosen remnant whose salvation is in a particular manner his
 will. <I>Secondly,</I> Christ was <I>sent into the world</I> on this 
 errand, to bring people to God, to know him and to be happy in him. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> He made this work his business and delight. When his 
 body needed food, his mind was so taken up with this that he forgot 
 both hunger and thirst, both meat and drink. Nothing could be more 
 grateful to him than doing good; when he was invited <I>to meat</I> he 
 went, that he might <I>do good,</I> for that was his meat always. 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> He was not only ready upon all occasions to go to his 
 work, but he was <I>earnest</I> and in care to go <I>through</I> it, 
 and to <I>finish his work</I> in all the parts of it. He resolved never 
 to quit it, nor lay it down, till he could say, <I>It is finished.</I> 
 Many have zeal to carry them <I>out</I> at first, but not zeal to carry 
 them <I>on</I> to the last; but our Lord Jesus was intent upon 
 <I>finishing his work.</I> Our Master has herein left us an example, 
 that we may learn to do the will of God as he did;

 1. With diligence and close application, as those that make a business
 of it. 

 2. With delight and pleasure in it, as in our element. 

 3. With constancy and perseverance; not only minding to <I>do,</I> but
 aiming to <I>finish,</I> our work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See here how Christ, having expressed his delight in <I>his</I> 
 work, excites his disciples to diligence in <I>their</I> work; they 
 were workers <I>with him,</I> and therefore should be workers <I>like 
 him,</I> and make their work their <I>meat,</I> as he did. The work 
 they had to do was to <I>preach the gospel,</I> and to set up the 
 kingdom of the Messiah. Now this work he here compares to <I>harvest 
 work,</I> the gathering in of the fruits of the earth; and this 
 similitude he prosecutes throughout the discourse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:35-38"><I>v.</I> 35-38</A>.

 Note, gospel time is harvest time, and gospel work harvest work. The 
 harvest is before <I>appointed</I> and expected; so was the gospel. 
 Harvest time is <I>busy</I> time; all hands must be then at work: every 
 one must work for <I>himself,</I> that he may reap of the graces and 
 comforts of the gospel: ministers must work <I>for God,</I> to gather 
 in souls to him. Harvest time is <I>opportunity,</I> a short and 
 limited time, which will not last always; and harvest work is work that 
 must be done <I>then</I> or not at all; so the time of the enjoyment of 
 the gospel is a particular season, which must be improved for its 
 proper purposes; for, once past, it cannot be recalled. The disciples 
 were to gather in a harvest of souls for Christ. Now he here suggests 
 three things to them to quicken them to diligence:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That it was <I>necessary work,</I> and the <I>occasion</I> for it 
 very urgent and pressing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>You say, It is four months to harvest;</I> but I say, <I>The fields 
 are already white.</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] A saying of Christ's disciples concerning the <I>corn-harvest;</I> 
 there <I>are yet four months, and then comes harvest,</I> which may be 
 taken either <I>generally</I>--"You say, for the encouragement of the
 sower at seed-time, that it will be but four months to the harvest." 
 With us it is but about four months between the barley-sowing and the 
 barley-harvest, probably it was so with them as to other grain; or, 
 "Particularly, now at this time you reckon it will be four months to 
 next harvest, according to the ordinary course of providence." The 
 Jews' harvest began at the Passover, about Easter, much earlier in the 
 year than ours, by which it appears that this journey of Christ from 
 Judea to Galilee was in the winter, about the end of November, for he 
 travelled <I>all weathers</I> to do good. God has not only promised us 
 a harvest every year, but has appointed the <I>weeks of harvest;</I> so 
 that we know <I>when</I> to expect it, and take our measures 
 accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] A saying of Christ's concerning the <I>gospel harvest;</I> his 
 heart was as much upon the fruits of his gospel as the hearts of others 
 were upon the fruits of the earth; and to this he would lead the 
 thoughts of his disciples: <I>Look, the fields are already white unto 
 the harvest. First,</I> Here in <I>this</I> place, where they 
 <I>now</I> were, there was harvest work for <I>him</I> to do. They 
 would have him to <I>eat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 "Eat!" saith he, "I have other work to do, that is more needful; 
 <I>look</I> what crowds of Samaritans are coming out of the town over 
 the fields that are ready to receive the gospel;" probably there were 
 many now in view. People's forwardness to hear the word is a great 
 excitement to ministers' diligence and liveliness in preaching it. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> In <I>other places,</I> all the country over, there 
 was harvest work enough for them all to do. "<I>Consider the
 regions,</I> think of the state of the country, and you will find there 
 are multitudes as ready to receive the gospel as a field of corn that 
 is fully ripe is ready to be reaped." The fields were now made <I>white 
 to the harvest,</I> 

 1. By the <I>decree of God</I> revealed in the prophecies of the Old
 Testament. Now was the time when the gathering of the people should be 
 to Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">
 Gen. xlix. 10</A>),
 
 when great accessions should be made to the church and the bounds of it 
 should be enlarged, and therefore it was time for them to be busy. It 
 is a great encouragement to us to engage in any work for God, if we 
 understand by the signs of the times that this is the proper season for 
 that work, for then it will prosper. 

 2. By the <I>disposition of men.</I> John Baptist had <I>made ready a
 people prepared for the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:17">Luke i. 17</A>.

 Since he began to preach the kingdom of God <I>every man pressed into
 it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:16">Luke xvi. 16</A>.

 This, therefore, was a time for the preachers of the gospel to apply
 themselves to their work with the utmost vigour, to <I>thrust in their 
 sickle,</I> when the harvest was ripe,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:15">Rev. xiv. 15</A>.

 It was <I>necessary</I> to work now, pity that such a season should be 
 let slip. If the corn that is <I>ripe</I> be not reaped, it will 
 <I>shed</I> and be lost, and the fowls will pick it up. If souls that 
 are under convictions, and have some good inclinations, be not helped 
 now, their hopeful beginnings will come to nothing, and they will be a 
 prey to pretenders. It was also <I>easy</I> to work now; when the 
 people's hearts are <I>prepared</I> the work will be done 
 <I>suddenly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:36">2 Chron. xxix. 36</A>.

 It cannot but quicken ministers to take <I>pains</I> in preaching the
 word when they observe that people <I>take pleasure</I> in hearing 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That it was <I>profitable</I> and <I>advantageous</I> work, which 
 they themselves would be gainers by 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 "<I>He that reapeth receiveth wages,</I> and so shall you." Christ has 
 undertaken to pay those well whom he employs in his work; for he will 
 never do as Jehoiakim did, <I>who used his neighbour's service without 
 wages</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:13">Jer. xxii. 13</A>),

 or those who <I>by fraud kept back the hire of those</I> particularly
 <I>who reaped their corn-fields,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:4">Jam. v. 4</A>.

 Christ's reapers, though they cry <I>to him</I> day and night, shall 
 never have cause to cry <I>against him,</I> nor to say they served a 
 hard Master. He that reapeth, not only <I>shall</I> but <I>does</I>
 receive wages. There is a present reward in the service of Christ, and
 his work is <I>its own wages.</I>

 [1.] Christ's reapers have <I>fruit: He gathereth fruit unto life 
 eternal;</I> that is, he shall both save himself and those that hear 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:16">1 Tim. iv. 16</A>.

 If the faithful reaper save his own soul, that is fruit abounding to
 his account, it is fruit gathered to <I>life eternal;</I> and if, over 
 and above this, he be instrumental to save the souls of others too, 
 there is <I>fruit gathered.</I> Souls gathered to Christ are fruit, 
 good fruit, the fruit that Christ seeks for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:13">Rom. i. 13</A>);
 
 it is gathered for Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:11,12">Cant. viii. 11, 12</A>);

 it is gathered to <I>life eternal.</I> This is the comfort of faithful 
 ministers, that their work has a tendency to the eternal salvation of 
 precious souls.

 [2.] They have <I>joy: That he that sows and they that reap may rejoice 
 together.</I> The minister who is the happy instrument of beginning a 
 good work is <I>he that sows,</I> as John Baptist; he that is employed 
 to carry it on and perfect it is <I>he that reaps:</I> and both shall 
 rejoice together. Note, <I>First,</I> Though God is to have all the 
 glory of the success of the gospel, yet faithful ministers may 
 themselves take the comfort of it. The reapers share in the <I>joy of 
 harvest,</I> though the profits belong to the master, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:19">1 Thess. ii. 19</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Those ministers who are variously gifted and employed
 should be so far from envying one another that they should rather 
 mutually rejoice in each other's success and usefulness. Though all 
 Christ's ministers are not alike <I>serviceable,</I> nor alike 
 <I>successful,</I> yet, if they have obtained mercy of the Lord to be 
 <I>faithful,</I> they shall all enter <I>together into the joy of their 
 Lord</I> at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That it was <I>easy work,</I> and work that was half done to their 
 hands by those that were gone before them: <I>One soweth, and another 
 reapeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>.

 This sometimes denotes a grievous judgment upon him that sows,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:15,De+28:30">Mic. vi. 15; Deut. xxviii. 30</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt sow, and another shall reap;</I> as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:11">Deut. vi. 11</A>,

 <I>Houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not.</I> So 
 here. Moses, and the prophets, and John Baptist, had <I>paved</I> the 
 way to the gospel, had sown the good seed which the New-Testament 
 ministers did in effect but gather the fruit of. <I>I send you to reap 
 that whereon you bestowed,</I> in comparison, no <I>labour.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3-5">Isa. xl. 3-5</A>.

 [1.] This intimates <I>two things</I> concerning the Old-Testament
 ministry:--<I>First,</I> That it was very much <I>short</I> of the 
 New-Testament ministry. Moses and the <I>prophets</I> sowed, but they 
 could not be said to <I>reap,</I> so little did they see of the fruit 
 of their labours. Their writings have done much more good since they 
 left us than ever their preaching did. <I>Secondly,</I> That it was
 very <I>serviceable</I> to the New-Testament ministry, and made way for 
 it. The writings of the prophets, which were read in the synagogues 
 every sabbath day, raised people's expectations of the Messiah, and so 
 prepared them to bid him welcome. Had it not been for the seed sown by 
 the prophets, this Samaritan woman could not have said, <I>We know that 
 Messias cometh.</I> The writings of the Old Testament are in some 
 respects more useful to us than they could be to those to whom they 
 were first written, because better understood by the accomplishment of 
 them. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:12,Heb+4:2,Ro+16:25,26">1 Pet. i. 12;
 Heb. iv. 2; Rom. xvi. 25, 26</A>.

 [2.] This also intimates <I>two things</I> concerning the ministry of
 the <I>apostles of Christ. First,</I> That it was a <I>fruitful</I>
 ministry: they were reapers that gathered in a great harvest of souls 
 to Jesus Christ, and did more in seven years towards the setting up of 
 the kingdom of God among men than the prophets of the Old Testament had 
 done in twice so many ages. <I>Secondly,</I> That it was much
 <I>facilitated,</I> especially among the Jews, to whom they were first 
 sent, by the writings of the prophets. The prophets <I>sowed in 
 tears,</I> crying out, <I>We have laboured in vain;</I> the apostles 
 <I>reaped in joy,</I> saying, <I>Thanks be to God, who always causeth 
 us to triumph.</I> Note, From the labours of ministers that are dead 
 and gone much good fruit may be reaped by the people that 
 <I>survive</I> them and the ministers that <I>succeed</I> them. John 
 Baptist, and those that assisted him, had <I>laboured,</I> and the 
 disciples of Christ entered into their labours, built upon their 
 foundation, and reaped the fruit of what they sowed. See what reason we 
 have to bless God for those that are <I>gone before us,</I> for their 
 preaching and their writing, for what they <I>did</I> and 
 <I>suffered</I> in their day, for we are <I>entered into their 
 labours;</I> their studies and services have made our work the easier. 
 And when the ancient and modern labourers, those that came into the 
 vineyard at the third hour and those that came in at the eleventh, meet 
 in the day of account, they will be so far from envying one another the 
 honour of their respective services that both <I>they that sowed</I> 
 and they that <I>reaped</I> shall rejoice together; and the great Lord 
 of thee harvest shall have the glory of all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The <I>good effect</I> which this visit Christ made to the 
 Samaritans (<I>en passant</I>) had upon them, and the fruit which was 
 now presently gathered among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:39-42"><I>v.</I> 39-42</A>.

 See what impressions were made on them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By the <I>woman's testimony</I> concerning <I>Christ;</I> though a 
 single testimony, and of one of no good report, and the testimony no 
 more than this, <I>He told me all that ever I did,</I> yet it had a 
 good influence upon many. One would have thought that his telling the 
 woman of her secret sins would have made them afraid of coming to him, 
 lest he should tell them also of their faults; but they will venture 
 that rather than not be acquainted with one who they had reason to 
 think was a prophet. And <I>two things</I> they were brought to:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To <I>credit</I> Christ's <I>word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>Many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying 
 of the woman.</I> So far they <I>believed on him</I> that they took him 
 for a <I>prophet,</I> and were desirous to know the mind of God from 
 him; this is favourably interpreted as believing on him. Now observe,

 [1.] Who they were that believed: <I>Many of the Samaritans,</I> who 
 were not of the house of Israel. Their faith was not only an 
 <I>aggravation</I> of the <I>unbelief</I> of the Jews, from whom better 
 might have been expected, but an <I>earnest</I> of the <I>faith</I> of 
 the Gentiles, who would welcome that which the Jews rejected. 

 [2.] Upon what inducement they believed: <I>For the saying of the 
 woman.</I> See here, <I>First,</I> How God is sometimes pleased to use 
 very weak and unlikely instruments for the beginning and carrying on of 
 a good work. A little maid directed a great prince to Elisha, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:2">2 Kings v. 2</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> How great a matter a little fire kindles. Our Saviour,
 by instructing one poor woman, spread instruction to a whole town. Let 
 not ministers be either <I>careless</I> in their preaching, or 
 <I>discouraged</I> in it, because their hearers are <I>few</I> and 
 <I>mean;</I> for, by doing good to <I>them,</I> good may be conveyed to 
 <I>more,</I> and those that are more considerable. If they <I>teach 
 every man his neighbour,</I> and <I>every man his brother,</I> a great 
 number may learn at <I>second hand.</I> Philip preached the gospel to a 
 single gentleman in his chariot upon the road, and he not only received 
 it himself, but carried it into his country, and propagated it there.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> See how good it is to speak <I>experimentally</I> of 
 Christ and the things of God. This woman could say little of Christ, 
 but what she did say she spoke feelingly: <I>He told me all that ever I
 did.</I> Those are most likely to do good that can tell what God has 
 done <I>for their souls,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:16">Ps. lxvi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They were brought to <I>court his stay</I> among them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):
 
 When they were come to him <I>they besought him that he would tarry 
 with them.</I> Upon the woman's report, they believed him to be a 
 prophet, and <I>came to him;</I> and, when they <I>saw</I> him, the 
 meanness of his appearance and the manifest poverty of his outward 
 condition did not lessen their esteem of him and expectations from him, 
 but still they respected him as a prophet. Note, There is hope of those 
 who are got over the vulgar prejudices that men have against <I>true 
 worth</I> in a <I>low estate.</I> Blessed are they that are not 
 offended in Christ at the <I>first sight.</I> So far were they from 
 being offended in him that they begged he would tarry with them; 

 [1.] That they might <I>testify their respect</I> to him, and treat him 
 with the honour and kindness due to his character. God's prophets and 
 ministers are welcome guests to all those who sincerely embrace the 
 gospel; as to Lydia, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:15">Acts xvi. 15</A>.

 [2.] That they might receive instruction from him. Those that are
 taught of God are truly desirous to learn more, and to be better 
 acquainted with Christ. Many would have flocked to one that would tell 
 them <I>their fortune,</I> but these flocked to one that would tell 
 them <I>their faults,</I> tell them of their sin and duty. The 
 historian seems to lay an emphasis upon their being Samaritans; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:33,17:16">Luke x. 33; xvii. 16</A>.

 The Samaritans had not that reputation for religion which the Jews had;
 yet the Jews, who saw Christ's miracles, drove him from them: while the 
 Samaritans, who saw not his miracles, nor shared in his favours, 
 invited him to them. The <I>proof</I> of the gospel's success is not 
 always according to the <I>probability,</I> nor what is 
 <I>experienced</I> according to what is <I>expected</I> either way. The 
 Samaritans were taught by the custom of their country to be shy of 
 conversation with the Jews. There were Samaritans that refused to let 
 Christ go through their town

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:53">Luke ix. 53</A>),

 but these begged him to tarry with them. Note, It adds much to the
 praise of our love to Christ and his word if it conquers the prejudices 
 of education and custom, and sets light by the censures of men. Now we 
 are told that Christ granted their request.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He <I>abode there.</I> Though it was a city of the 
 Samaritans nearly adjoining to their temple, yet, when he was 
 <I>invited,</I> he <I>tarried</I> there; though he was upon a journey, 
 and had further to go, yet, when he had an opportunity of doing good, 
 he <I>abode there.</I> That is no real <I>hindrance</I> which will 
 <I>further</I> our account. Yet he abode there but <I>two days,</I> 
 because he had other places to visit and other work to do, and those 
 <I>two</I> days were as many as came to the share of this city, out of 
 the few days of our Saviour's sojourning upon earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> We are told what impressions were made upon them by 
 Christ's own word, and his personal converse with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:41,42"><I>v.</I> 41, 42</A>);
 
 what he <I>said</I> and <I>did</I> there is not related, whether he 
 healed their sick or no; but it is intimated, in the effect, that he 
 said and did that which convinced them that he was the Christ; and the 
 labours of a minister are best told by the good fruit of them. Their 
 hearing of <I>him</I> had a good effect, but <I>now their eyes saw 
 him;</I> and the effect was, 
 
 1. That their number grew
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 <I>Many more believed:</I> many that would not be persuaded to go out 
 of the town to him were yet wrought upon, when he came among them, to 
 believe in him. Note, It is comfortable to see the number of believers; 
 and sometimes the zeal and forwardness of some may be a means to 
 provoke many, and to stir them up to a holy emulation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14">Rom. xi. 14</A>.

 2. That their faith grew. Those who had been wrought upon by the
 report of the woman now saw cause to say, <I>Now we believe, not 
 because of thy saying,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 Here are three things in which their <I>faith grew:</I>--

 (1.) In the matter of it, or that which they did believe. Upon the
 testimony of the woman, they believed him to be <I>a prophet,</I> or 
 some extraordinary messenger from heaven; but now that they have 
 conversed with him they believe that he is <I>the Christ,</I> the 
 <I>Anointed One,</I> the very same that was promised to the fathers and 
 expected by them, and that, being the <I>Christ,</I> he is the 
 <I>Saviour of the world;</I> for the work to which he was anointed was 
 to <I>save his people from their sins.</I> They believed him to be the 
 Saviour not only of the Jews, but <I>of the world,</I> which they hoped 
 would take them in, though Samaritans, for it was promised that he 
 should be <I>Salvation to the ends of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:6">
 Isa. xlix. 6</A>.

 (2.) In the <I>certainty</I> of it; their faith now grew up to a full 
 assurance: <I>We know</I> that this is indeed the <I>Christ;</I> 
 <B><I>alethos</I></B>--<I>truly;</I> not a pretended Christ, but a real 
 one; not a <I>typical</I> Saviour, as many under the Old Testament, but 
 <I>truly</I> one. Such an assurance as this of divine truths is what we 
 should labour after; not only, We think it probable, and are willing to 
 suppose that <I>Jesus</I> may be the <I>Christ,</I> but, We know that 
 he is <I>indeed the Christ.</I> 

 (3.) In the <I>ground</I> of it, which was a kind of spiritual 
 sensation and experience: <I>Now we believe, not because of thy saying, 
 for we have heard him ourselves.</I> They had before <I>believed for 
 her saying,</I> and it was well, it was a good step; but now they find 
 <I>further</I> and much <I>firmer</I> footing for their faith: "<I>Now 
 we believe</I> because we have <I>heard him ourselves,</I> and have 
 heard such excellent and divine truths, accompanied with such 
 commanding power and evidence, that we are abundantly satisfied and 
 assured that <I>this is the Christ.</I>" This is like what the queen of 
 Sheba said of Solomon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:6,7">1 Kings x. 6, 7</A>):

 The <I>one half was not told me.</I> The Samaritans, who believed for 
 the woman's saying, now gained further light; for <I>to him that hath 
 shall be given;</I> he that is faithful in a little shall be trusted 
 with more. In this instance we may see how <I>faith comes by 
 hearing.</I>

 [1.] Faith comes <I>to the birth</I> by hearing the <I>report of 
 men.</I> These Samaritans, for the sake of the woman's saying, believed 
 so far as to <I>come and see,</I> to come and make trial. Thus the 
 instructions of parents and preachers, and the testimony of the church 
 and our experienced neighbours, <I>recommend</I> the doctrine of Christ 
 <I>to our acquaintance,</I> and incline us to entertain it as highly 
 probable. But, 

 [2.] Faith <I>comes to its growth,</I> strength, and maturity, by 
 hearing the testimony of Christ himself; and this goes further, and 
 recommends his doctrine <I>to our acceptance,</I> and obliges us to 
 believe it as undoubtedly certain. We were induced to look into the 
 scriptures <I>by the saying</I> of those who told us that in them they 
 had found eternal life; but when we ourselves have found it in them 
 too, have experienced the enlightening, convincing, regenerating, 
 sanctifying, comforting, power of the word, now we believe, <I>not for 
 their saying,</I> but because we have searched them ourselves: and our 
 faith <I>stands not in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God,</I>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>43  Now after two days he departed thence, and went into
 Galilee.
 &nbsp; 44  For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour
 in his own country.
 &nbsp; 45  Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galil&aelig;ans received
 him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the
 feast: for they also went unto the feast.
 &nbsp; 46  So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the
 water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick
 at Capernaum.
 &nbsp; 47  When he heard that Jesus was come out of Jud&aelig;a into
 Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come
 down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
 &nbsp; 48  Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders,
 ye will not believe.
 &nbsp; 49  The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child
 die.
 &nbsp; 50  Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the
 man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went
 his way.
 &nbsp; 51  And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told
 <I>him,</I> saying, Thy son liveth.
 &nbsp; 52  Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend.
 And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
 left him.
 &nbsp; 53  So the father knew that <I>it was</I> at the same hour, in the
 which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed,
 and his whole house.
 &nbsp; 54  This <I>is</I> again the second miracle <I>that</I> Jesus did, when he
 was come out of Jud&aelig;a into Galilee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's <I>coming</I> into Galilee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 Though he was as welcome among the Samaritans as he could be any where, 
 and had better success, yet <I>after two days</I> he left them, not so 
 much because they were Samaritans, and he would not confirm those in 
 their prejudices against him who said, <I>He is a Samaritan</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:48"><I>ch.</I> viii. 48</A>),

 but because <I>he must preach to other cities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:43">Luke iv. 43</A>.

 <I>He went into Galilee,</I> for there he spent much of his time. Now
 see here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Whither Christ went; into Galilee, into the country of Galilee, but 
 not to Nazareth, which was strictly <I>his own</I> country. He went 
 among the villages, but declined going to Nazareth, the head city, for 
 a reason here given, which <I>Jesus himself testified,</I> who knew the 
 temper of his countrymen, the hearts of all men, and the experiences of 
 all prophets, and it is this, That <I>a prophet has no honour in his 
 own country.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Prophets ought to have honour, because God has put honour upon 
 them and we do or may receive benefit by them. 

 (2.) The honour due to the Lord's prophets has very often been denied 
 them, and contempt put upon them. 

 (3.) This <I>due</I> honour is more frequently denied them <I>in their 
 own country;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:24,Mt+13:57">Luke iv. 24; Matt. xiii. 57</A>.

 Not that it is universally true (no rule but has some exceptions), but
 it holds for the most part. Joseph, when he began to be a prophet, was
 most hated by his brethren; David was disdained by his brother 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:28">1 Sam. xvii. 28</A>);
 
 Jeremiah was maligned by the men of Anathoth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:21">Jer. xi. 21</A>),

 Paul by his countrymen the Jews; and Christ's near kinsmen spoke most 
 slightly of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:5"><I>ch.</I> vii. 5</A>.

 Men's pride and envy make them scorn to be instructed by those who once
 were their school-fellows and play-fellows. Desire of novelty, and of
 that which is far-fetched and dear-bought, and seems to drop out of the 
 sky to them, makes them despise those persons and things which they 
 have been long used to and know the rise of. 

 (4.) It is a great discouragement to a minister to go among a people 
 who have no value for him or his labours. Christ would not go to 
 Nazareth, because he knew how little respect he should have there. 

 (5.) It is just with God to deny his gospel to those that despise the 
 ministers of it. They that mock the messengers forfeit the benefit of

 2. What entertainment he met with among the Galileans in the country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>):

 They <I>received him,</I> bade him welcome, and cheerfully attended on 
 his doctrine. Christ and his gospel are not sent in vain; if they have 
 not honour with <I>some,</I> they shall have with <I>others.</I> Now 
 the reason given why these Galileans were so ready to receive Christ is 
 because they had seen <I>the miracles he did at Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 (1.) They went up to Jerusalem at the feast, the feast of the passover. 
 The Galileans lay very remote from Jerusalem, and their way thither lay 
 through the country of the Samaritans, which was troublesome for a Jew 
 to pass through, worse than Baca's valley of old; yet, in obedience to 
 God's command, they <I>went up to the feast,</I> and there they became 
 acquainted with Christ. Note, They that are diligent and constant in
 attending on public ordinances some time or other meet with more 
 spiritual benefit than they expect. 

 (2.) At Jerusalem they <I>saw</I> Christ's miracles, which recommended 
 him and his doctrine very much to their faith and affections. The 
 miracles were wrought for the benefit of those at Jerusalem; yet the 
 Galileans who were accidentally there got more advantage by them than 
 they did for whom they were chiefly designed. Thus the word preached
 to a <I>mixed multitude</I> may perhaps edify <I>occasional</I> hearers 
 more than the constant auditory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What city he went to. When he would go to a city, he chose to go to 
 Cana of Galilee, <I>where he had made the water wine</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>);
 
 thither he went, to see if there were any good fruits of that miracle 
 remaining; and, if there were, to confirm their faith, and water what 
 he had planted. The evangelist mentions this miracle here to teach us 
 to keep in remembrance what we <I>have seen</I> of the works of 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His <I>curing</I> the <I>nobleman's son</I> that was sick of a 
 fever. This story is not recorded by any other of the evangelists; it 
 comes in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:23">Matt. iv. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. Who the <I>petitioner</I> was, and who the <I>patient:</I> the
 petitioner was a <I>nobleman;</I> the patient was his son: <I>There was 
 a certain nobleman. Regulus</I> (so the Latin), a <I>little king;</I> 
 so called, either for the largeness of his estate, or the extent of his 
 power, or the royalties that belonged to his manor. Some understand it 
 as denoting his <I>preferment</I>--he was a courtier in some office 
 about the king; others as denoting his <I>party</I>--he was an 
 Herodian, a royalist, a prerogative-man, one that espoused the 
 interests of the Herods, father and son; perhaps it was Chuza, Herod's 
 steward

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:3">Luke viii. 3</A>),

 or Man&aelig;n, Herod's foster-brother, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:1">Acts xiii. 1</A>.

 There were saints in C&aelig;sar's household. The father a nobleman, 
 and yet the son sick; for dignities and titles of honour will be no 
 security to persons and families from the assaults of sickness and 
 death. It was fifteen miles from Capernaum where this nobleman lived to 
 Cana, where Christ now was; yet this affliction in his family sent him 
 so far to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How the petitioner made <I>his application</I> to the physician. 
 Having heard that <I>Jesus was come out of</I> Judea to Galilee, and 
 finding that he did not come towards Capernaum, but turned off towards 
 the other side of the country, he <I>went to him</I> himself, and 
 <I>besought him to come and heal his son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.
 
 See here,

 (1.) His <I>tender affection</I> to his son, that when he was sick he 
 would spare no pains to get help for him. 

 (2.) His <I>great respect</I> to our Lord Jesus, that he would come 
 himself to wait upon him, when he might have sent a servant; and that 
 he <I>besought him,</I> when, as a man in authority, some would think 
 he might have ordered his attendance. The greatest men, when they come 
 to God, must become beggars, and sue <I>sub forma pauperis--as 
 paupers.</I> As to the errand he came upon, we may observe a mixture in 
 <I>his faith.</I>

 [1.] There was <I>sincerity</I> in it; he did believe that Christ could 
 heal his son, though his disease was dangerous. It is probable he had 
 physicians to him, who had given him over; but he believed that Christ 
 could cure him when the case seemed deplorable. 

 [2.] Yet there was <I>infirmity</I> in his faith; he believed that 
 Christ could heal his son, but, as it should seem, he thought he could 
 not heal him at a distance, and therefore he besought him that he would 
 <I>come down</I> and heal him, expecting, as Naaman did, that he would 
 come and <I>strike his hand</I> over the patient, as if he could not 
 cure him but by a <I>physical contact.</I> Thus we are apt to <I>limit 
 the Holy One of Israel,</I> and to stint him to our forms. The 
 centurion, a Gentile, a soldier, was so strong in faith as to say, 
 <I>Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:8">Matt. viii. 8</A>.

 This nobleman, a Jew, must have Christ to come down, though it was a
 good day's journey, and despairs of a cure unless he come down, as if 
 he must teach Christ how to work. We are encouraged to <I>pray,</I> but 
 we are not allowed to prescribe: Lord, heal me; but, whether with a 
 word or a touch, <I>thy will be done.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The gentle rebuke he met with in this address 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>):

 <I>Jesus said to him,</I> "I see how it is; <I>except you see signs and 
 wonders, you will not believe,</I> as the Samaritans did, though they 
 saw no signs and wonders, and therefore I must work miracles among 
 you." Though he was a <I>nobleman,</I> and now in <I>grief</I> about 
 his son, and had shown great respect to Christ in coming so far to him, 
 yet Christ gives him a reproof. Men's dignity in the world shall not 
 exempt them from the rebukes of the word or providence; for Christ 
 reproves not <I>after the hearing of his ears,</I> but <I>with
 equity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:3,4">Isa. xi. 3, 4</A>.

 Observe, Christ first shows him his sin and weakness, to prepare him 
 for mercy, and then grants his request. Those whom Christ intends to 
 honour with his <I>favours</I> he first <I>humbles</I> with his 
 <I>frowns.</I> The <I>Comforter</I> shall first <I>convince.</I> Herod 
 longed to see some miracle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:8">Luke xxiii. 8</A>),

 and this courtier was of the same mind, and the generality of the
 people too. Now that which is blamed is,

 (1.) That, whereas they had heard by credible and incontestable report 
 of the miracles he had wrought in other places, they would not believe
 except they saw them with their own eyes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:23">Luke iv. 23</A>.

 They must be <I>honoured,</I> and they must be <I>humoured,</I> or they 
 will not be <I>convinced.</I> Their country must be graced, and their 
 curiosity gratified, with signs and wonders, or else, though the 
 doctrine of Christ be sufficiently proved by miracles wrought 
 elsewhere, they <I>will not believe.</I> Like Thomas, they will yield 
 to no method of conviction but what they shall prescribe.

 (2.) That, whereas they had seen divers miracles, the evidence of which
 they could not gainsay, but which sufficiently proved Christ to be a 
 teacher come from God, and should now have applied themselves to him 
 for instruction in his doctrine, which by its native excellency would 
 have <I>gently led them on,</I> in believing, to a spiritual 
 perfection, instead of this they would go no further in believing than 
 they were <I>driven</I> by signs and wonders. The <I>spiritual</I> 
 power of the word did not <I>affect them,</I> did not <I>attract</I> 
 them, but only the <I>sensible</I> power of miracles, which were <I>for 
 those</I> who believe not, while <I>prophesying</I> was for <I>those 
 that believe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:22">1 Cor. xiv. 22</A>.

 Those that admire <I>miracles</I> only, and <I>despise prophesying,</I>
 rank themselves with unbelievers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. His continued importunity in his address 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):

 <I>Sir, come down ere my child die.</I> 
 <B><I>Kyrie</I></B>--<I>Lord;</I> so it should be rendered. In this 
 reply of his we have, 

 (1.) Something that was commendable: he took the reproof patiently; he 
 spoke to Christ respectfully. Though he was one of those that wore soft 
 clothing, yet he could bear reproof. It is none of the privileges of 
 peerage to be above the reproofs of the word of Christ; but it is a 
 sign of a good temper and disposition in men, especially in great men, 
 when they can be told of their faults and not be angry. And, as he did 
 not take the reproof for an affront, so he did not take it for a 
 denial, but still prosecuted his request, and continued to wrestle till 
 he prevailed. Nay, he might argue thus: "If Christ heal <I>my
 soul,</I> surely he will heal <I>my son;</I> if he cure <I>my</I> 
 unbelief, he will cure <I>his</I> fever." This is the method Christ 
 takes, first to work <I>upon</I> us, and then to work <I>for</I> us; 
 and there is hope if we find him entering upon this method. 

 (2.) Something that was blameworthy, that was his infirmity; for,

 [1.] He seems to take no notice of the reproof Christ gave him, says 
 nothing to it, by way either of confession or of excuse, for he is so 
 wholly taken up with concern about his child that he can mind nothing 
 else. Note, The sorrow of the world is a great prejudice to our 
 profiting by the word of Christ. Inordinate care and grief are thorns 
 that choke the good seed; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:9">Exod. vi. 9</A>.

 [2.] He still discovered the weakness of his faith in the power of
 Christ. <I>First,</I> He must have Christ to come down, thinking that 
 else he could do the child no kindness. It is hard to persuade 
 ourselves that distance of time and place are no obstructions to the 
 knowledge and power of our Lord Jesus; yet so it is: he sees afar off, 
 for his word, the word of his power, <I>runs very swiftly.
 Secondly,</I> He believes that Christ could heal a <I>sick</I> child, 
 but not that he could raise a <I>dead</I> child, and therefore, "O 
 <I>come down, ere my child die,</I>" as if then it would be too late; 
 whereas Christ has the same power over death that he has over bodily 
 diseases. He forgot that Elijah and Elisha had raised dead children; 
 and is Christ's power inferior to theirs? Observe what haste he is in: 
 <I>Come down, ere my child die;</I> as if there were danger of Christ's 
 slipping his time. <I>He that believeth does not make haste,</I> but 
 refers himself to Christ. "Lord, what and when and how thou pleasest." 
 </P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The answer of peace which Christ gave to his request at last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>):

 <I>Go thy way, thy son liveth.</I> Christ here gives us an instance, 
 
 (1.) Of his <I>power,</I> that he not only could heal, but could heal 
 with so much ease, without the trouble of a visit. Here is nothing 
 <I>said,</I> nothing <I>done,</I> nothing <I>ordered</I> to be done, 
 and yet the cure wrought: <I>Thy son liveth.</I> The healing beams of 
 the Sun of righteousness dispense benign influences from one end of 
 heaven to another, and <I>there is nothing hid from the heat 
 thereof.</I> Though Christ is now in heaven, and his church on earth, 
 he can <I>send from above.</I> This nobleman would have Christ <I>come 
 down and heal his son;</I> Christ will heal his son, and not <I>come 
 down.</I> And thus the cure is the sooner wrought, the nobleman's 
 mistake rectified, and his faith confirmed; so that the thing was 
 better done in Christ's way. When he denies what we ask, he gives what 
 is much more to our advantage; we ask for ease, he gives patience.
 Observe, His power was exerted by his word. In saying, <I>Thy son 
 lives,</I> he showed that he has <I>life in himself,</I> and power to 
 <I>quicken whom he will.</I> Christ's saying, <I>Thy soul lives,</I> 
 makes it alive. 

 (2.) Of his <I>pity;</I> he observed the nobleman to be <I>in pain</I> 
 about his son, and his natural affection discovered itself in that 
 word, <I>Ere my child,</I> my dear child, die; and therefore Christ 
 dropped the reproof, and gave him assurance of the recovery of his 
 child; for he knows how a father <I>pities his children.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The nobleman's belief of the word of Christ: He <I>believed,</I> and 
 <I>went away.</I> Though Christ did not gratify him so far as to go 
 down with him, he is satisfied with the method Christ took, and reckons 
 he has gained his point. How quickly, how easily, is that which is 
 lacking in our faith perfected by the word and power of Christ. Now he 
 <I>sees no sign or wonder,</I> and yet <I>believes</I> the wonder done. 
 
 (1.) Christ said, <I>Thy son liveth,</I> and the man <I>believed</I> 
 him; not only believed the omniscience of Christ, that he <I>knew</I> 
 the child had recovered, but the omnipotence of Christ, that the cure 
 was <I>effected</I> by his word. He left him <I>dying;</I> yet, when 
 Christ said, <I>He lives,</I> like the father of the faithful, 
 <I>against hope he believed in hope,</I> and <I>staggered not through 
 unbelief.</I> 

 (2.) Christ said, <I>Go thy way;</I> and, as an evidence of the 
 sincerity of his faith, he <I>went his way,</I> and gave neither Christ 
 nor himself any further disturbance. He did not press Christ to come 
 down, did not say, "If he do recover, yet a visit will be acceptable;" 
 no, he seems no further solicitous, but, like Hannah, he goes his way, 
 and his countenance is <I>no more sad.</I> As one entirely satisfied, 
 he made no great haste home; did not hurry home that night, but 
 returned leisurely, as one that was perfectly easy in his own mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. The further confirmation of his faith, by comparing notes with his 
 servants at his return. 

 (1.) His servants met him with the agreeable news of the child's 
 recovery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>.

 Probably they met him not far from his own house, and, knowing what 
 their master's cares were, they were willing as soon as they could to 
 make him easy. David's servants were loth to tell him when the child 
 was dead. Christ said, <I>Thy son liveth;</I> and now the servants say 
 the same. Good news will meet those that hope in God's word.

 (2.) He enquired what hour the child began to recover 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>);

 not as if he doubted the influence of Christ's word upon the child's 
 recovery, but he was desirous to have his faith confirmed, that he 
 might be able to satisfy any to whom he should mention the miracle; for 
 it was a material circumstance. Note,

 [1.] It is good to furnish ourselves with all the corroborating proofs 
 and evidences that may be, to strengthen our faith in the word of 
 Christ, that it may grow up to <I>a full assurance. Show me a token
 for good.</I> 

 [2.] The diligent comparison of the works of Christ with his word will 
 be of great use to us for the confirming of our faith. This was the
 course the nobleman took: <I>He enquired of the servants the hour when 
 he began to amend;</I> and they told him, <I>Yesterday at the seventh 
 hour</I> (at one o'clock in the afternoon, or, as some think this 
 evangelist reckons, at seven o'clock at night) the <I>fever left 
 him;</I> not only he began to amend, but he was perfectly well on a 
 sudden; so <I>the father knew that it was at the same hour</I> when 
 Jesus said to him, <I>Thy son liveth.</I> As the word of God, 
 well-studied, will help us to understand his providences, so the 
 providence of God, well observed, will help us to understand his word; 
 for God is every day <I>fulfilling the scripture.</I> Two things would 
 help to confirm his faith:--<I>First,</I> That the child's recovery was 
 <I>sudden</I> and not <I>gradual.</I> They name the precise time to an 
 hour: <I>Yesterday,</I> not <I>about,</I> but <I>at</I> the seventh 
 hour, <I>the fever left him;</I> not it <I>abated,</I> or began to 
 <I>decrease,</I> but it <I>left him</I> in an instant. The word of 
 Christ did not work like physic, which must have time to operate, and 
 produce the effect, and perhaps <I>cures by expectation</I> only; no, 
 with Christ it was <I>dictum factum--he spoke and it was done;</I>
 not, He spoke and it was <I>set a doing. Secondly,</I> That it was just 
 at the same time that Christ spoke to him: <I>at that very hour.</I> 
 The synchronisms and coincidents of events add very much to the beauty 
 and harmony of Providence. Observe the <I>time,</I> and the 
 <I>thing</I> itself will be more illustrious, for every thing is 
 beautiful <I>in its time;</I> at the very time when it is 
 <I>promised,</I> as Israel's deliverance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:41">Exod. xii. 41</A>);

 at the very time when it is <I>prayed for,</I> as Peter's deliverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:12">Acts xii. 12</A>.

 In men's works, distance of place is the delay of time and the 
 retarding of business; but it is not so in the works of Christ. The 
 pardon, and peace, and comfort, and spiritual healing, which he speaks 
 in heaven, are, if he pleases, at the same time effected and wrought in 
 the souls of believers; and, when these two come to be <I>compared</I> 
 in the great day, Christ will be <I>glorified in his saints, and 
 admired in all them that believe.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. The <I>happy effect and issue of this.</I> The bringing of the cure 
 to the family brought salvation to it. 

 (1.) The nobleman <I>himself believed.</I> He had before 
 <I>believed</I> the word of Christ, with reference to this particular 
 occasion; but now he <I>believed in Christ</I> as the Messiah promised, 
 and became one of his disciples. Thus the <I>particular</I> experience
 of the power and efficacy of <I>one</I> word of Christ may be a happy 
 means to introduce and settle the whole authority of Christ's dominion 
 in the soul. Christ has many ways of gaining the heart, and by the 
 grant of a <I>temporal</I> mercy may make way for <I>better</I> things. 
 
 (2.) His <I>whole house</I> believed likewise.

 [1.] Because of the <I>interest</I> they all had in the miracle, which 
 preserved the <I>blossom</I> and <I>hopes</I> of the family; this 
 affected them all, and endeared Christ to them, and recommended him to 
 their best thoughts. 

 [2.] Because of the <I>influence</I> the master of the family had upon 
 them <I>all.</I> A master of a family cannot give faith to those under 
 his charge, nor <I>force</I> them to believe, but he may be 
 instrumental to remove <I>external prejudices,</I> which obstruct the 
 operation of the evidence, and then the work is more than half done. 
 <I>Abraham</I> was famous for this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19">Gen. xviii. 19</A>),
 
 and Joshua,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+24:15"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 15</A>.

 This was a <I>nobleman,</I> and probably he had a <I>great
 household;</I> but, when he comes into Christ's school, he brings them 
 all along with him. What a blessed change was here in this house,
 occasioned by the sickness of the child! This should reconcile us to 
 afflictions; we know not what good may follow from them. Probably, the 
 conversion of this <I>nobleman</I> and his family at Capernaum might 
 induce Christ to come afterwards, and settle at Capernaum, as his 
 head-quarters in Galilee. When great men receive the gospel, they may
 be instrumental to bring it to the places where they live.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. Here is the evangelist's remark upon this cure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>);

 <I>This is the second miracle,</I> referring to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:11"><I>ch.</I> ii. 11</A>,

 where the turning of water into wine is said to be the first; that was
 soon after his first return out of Judea, this soon after his second. 
 In Judea he had wrought many miracles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:2,4:45"><I>ch.</I> iii. 2; iv. 45</A>.

 They had the first offer; but, being driven thence, he wrought miracles
 in Galilee. Somewhere or other Christ will find a welcome. People may, 
 if they please, shut the sun out of <I>their own houses,</I> but they 
 cannot shut it <I>out of the world.</I> This is noted to be the 
 <I>second</I> miracle, 

 1. To remind us of the first, wrought in the same place some months 
 before. <I>Fresh</I> mercies should revive the remembrance of former 
 mercies, as former mercies should encourage our hopes of further 
 mercies. Christ keeps account of his favours, whether we do or no. 

 2. To let us know that <I>this</I> cure was <I>before</I> those many
 cures which the other evangelists mention to be wrought in Galilee,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:23,Mk+1:34,Lu+4:40">Matt. iv. 23; 
 Mark i. 34; Luke iv. 40</A>.

 Probably, the patient being a person of quality, the cure was the more
 talked of and sent him crowds of patients; when this nobleman applied 
 himself to Christ, multitudes followed. What abundance of good may 
 great men do, if they be good men!</P>
