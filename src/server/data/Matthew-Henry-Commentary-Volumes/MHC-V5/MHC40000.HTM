 have now before us,

 I. <I>The New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ;</I> so 
 this second part of the holy Bible is entitled: The <I>new
 covenant;</I> so it might as well be rendered; the word signifies both.
 But, when it is (as here) spoken of as Christ's act and deed, it is 
 most properly rendered a <I>testament,</I> for he is the testator, and 
 it becomes of force <I>by his death</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:16,17">Heb. ix. 16, 17</A>);
 
 nor is there, as in covenants, a previous treaty between the parties,
 but what is granted, though an estate upon condition, is owing to the 
 will, the free-will, the good-will, of the Testator. All the grace 
 contained in this book is owing to Jesus Christ as our Lord and 
 Saviour; and, unless we consent to him as our Lord, we cannot expect 
 any benefit by him as our Saviour. This is called a <I>new</I> 
 testament, to distinguish it from that which was given by Moses, and 
 was not antiquated; and to signify that it should be always new, and 
 should never wax old, and grow out of date. These books contain, not 
 only a full discovery of that grace <I>which has appeared to all men, 
 bringing salvation,</I> but a legal instrument by which it is conveyed 
 to, and settled upon, all believers. How carefully do we preserve, and 
 with what attention and pleasure do we read, the last will and 
 testament of a friend, who has therein left us a fair estate, and, with 
 it, high expressions of his love to us! How precious then should this 
 testament of our blessed Saviour be to us, which secures to us all his 
 unsearchable riches! It is <I>his</I> testament; for though, as is 
 usual, it was written by others (we have nothing upon record that was 
 of Christ's own writing), yet he dictated it; and the night before he 
 died, in the institution of his supper, he signed, sealed, and 
 published it, in the presence of twelve witnesses. For, though these 
 books were not written for some years after, for the benefit of 
 posterity, <I>in perpetuam rei memoriam--as a perpetual memorial,</I>
 yet the New Testament of our Lord Jesus was settled, confirmed, and 
 declared, from the time of his death, as a nuncupative will, with which 
 these records exactly agree. The things which St. Luke wrote were 
 <I>things which were most surely believed,</I> and therefore well 
 known, before he wrote them; but, when they were written, the oral 
 tradition was superseded and set aside, and these writings were the 
 repository of that New Testament. This is intimated by the title which 
 is prefixed to many Greek Copies, <B><I>Tes kaines Diathekes 
 Hapanta</I></B>--<I>The whole of the New Testament,</I> or <I>all the
 things of it.</I> In it is declared <I>the whole counsel of God</I> 
 concerning our salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:27">Acts xx. 27</A>.

 As <I>the law of the Lord is perfect,</I> so is the gospel of Christ,
 and nothing is to be added to it. We have it all, and are to look for 
 no more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have before us <I>The Four Gospels. Gospel</I> signifies <I>good 
 news,</I> or <I>glad tidings;</I> and this history of Christ's coming 
 <I>into the world to save sinners</I> is, without doubt, the best news
 that ever came from heaven to earth; the angel gave it this title 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:10">Luke ii. 10</A>),

 <B><I>Euangelizomai hymin</I></B>--<I>I bring you good tidings; I bring
 the gospel to you.</I> And the prophet foretold it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:7,61:1">Isa. lii. 7; lxi. 1</A>.

 It is there foretold that in the days of the messiah <I>good
 tidings</I> should be preached. <I>Gospel</I> is an old Saxon word; it 
 is <I>God's spell</I> or <I>word;</I> and God is so called because he 
 is good, <I>Deus optimus--God most excellent,</I> and therefore it may 
 be a good spell, or word. If we take <I>spell</I> in its more proper 
 signification for a <I>charm (carmen</I>), and take that in a good 
 sense, for what is moving and affecting, which is apt <I>lenire 
 dolorem--to calm the spirits,</I> or to raise them in admiration or 
 love, as that which is very amiable we call charming, it is applicable 
 to the gospel; for in it the charmer <I>charmeth wisely,</I> though to 
 <I>deaf adders,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:4,5">Ps. lviii. 4, 5</A>.

 Nor (one would think) can any charms be so powerful as those of the
 beauty and love of our Redeemer. The whole New Testament is the gospel. 
 St. Paul calls it <I>his</I> gospel, because he was one of the 
 preachers of it. Oh that we may each of us make it ours by our cordial 
 acceptance of it and subjection to it! But the four books which contain 
 the history of the Redeemer we commonly call <I>the four gospels,</I> 
 and the inspired penmen of them <I>evangelists,</I> or 
 <I>gospel-writers;</I> not, however, very properly, because that title 
 belongs to a particular order of ministers, that were assistants to the 
 apostles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11">Eph. iv. 11</A>):

 <I>He gave some apostles, and some evangelists.</I> It was requisite
 that the doctrine of Christ should be interwoven with, and founded 
 upon, the narrative of his birth, life, miracles, death, and 
 resurrection; for then it appears in its clearest and strongest light. 
 As in nature, so in grace, the most happy discoveries are those which 
 take rise from the certain representations of matters of fact. Natural 
 history is the best philosophy; and so is the sacred history, both of 
 the Old and New Testament, the most proper and grateful vehicle of 
 sacred truth. These four gospels were early and constantly received by 
 the primitive church, and read in Christian assemblies, as appears by 
 the writings of Justin Martyr and Iren&aelig;us, who lived little more 
 than a hundred years after the ascension of Christ; they declared that 
 neither more nor fewer than four were received by the church. A Harmony 
 of these four evangelists was compiled by Tatian about that time, which 
 he called, <B><I>To dia tessaron</I></B>--<I>The Gospel out of the 
 four.</I> In the third and fourth centuries there were gospels forged 
 by divers sects, and published, one under the name of St. Peter, 
 another of St. Thomas, another of St. Philip, &c. But they were never
 owned by the church, nor was any credit given to them, as the learned 
 Dr. Whitby shows. And he gives this good reason why we should adhere to 
 these written records, because, whatever the pretences of tradition may 
 be, it is not sufficient to preserve things with any certainty, as 
 appears by experience. For, whereas Christ said and did many memorable 
 things, which <I>were not written</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:30,21:25">John xx. 30; xxi. 25</A>),

 tradition has not preserved any one of them to us, but all is lost
 except what was written; that therefore is what we must abide by; and 
 blessed by God that we have it to abide by; it is the sure word of 
 history.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have before us <I>the Gospel according to St. Matthew.</I> The 
 penman was by birth a Jew, by calling a publican, till Christ commanded 
 his attendance, and then he left <I>the receipt of custom,</I> to 
 follow him, and was one of those that accompanied him <I>all the time 
 that the Lord Jesus went in and out, beginning from the baptism of John 
 unto the day that he was taken up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:21,22">Acts i. 21, 22</A>.

 He was therefore a competent witness of what he has here recorded. He
 is said to have written this history about eight years after Christ's 
 ascension. Many of the ancients say that he wrote it in the Hebrew or 
 Syriac language; but the tradition is sufficiently disproved by Dr. 
 Whitby. Doubtless, it was written in Greek, as the other parts of the 
 New Testament were; not in that language which was peculiar to the 
 Jews, whose church and state were near a period, but in that which was 
 common to the world, and in which the knowledge of Christ would be most 
 effectually transmitted to the nations of the earth; yet it is probable 
 that there might be an edition of it in Hebrew, published by St. 
 Matthew himself, at the same time that he wrote it in Greek; the former 
 for the Jews, the latter for the Gentiles, when he left Judea, to 
 preach among the Gentiles. Let us bless God that we have it, and have 
 it in a language we understand.</P>
