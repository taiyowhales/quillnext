 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter, we have our Lord Jesus, as the great Prophet teaching, 
 as the great Physician healing, and as the great Shepherd of the sheep 
 feeding; as the Father of spirits instructing them; as the Conqueror of 
 Satan dispossessing him; and as concerned for the bodies of his people, 
 providing for them. Here is, 

 I. Christ's discourse with the scribes and Pharisees about human
 traditions and injunctions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. His discourse with the multitude, and with his disciples,
 concerning the things that defile a man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:10-20">ver. 10-20</A>.

 III. His casting of the devil out of the woman of Canaan's daughter, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:21-28">ver. 21-28</A>.

 IV. His healing of all that were brought to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:29-31">ver. 29-31</A>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
 Jerusalem, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
 for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
 &nbsp; 3  But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
 the commandment of God by your tradition?
 &nbsp; 4  For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,
 He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
 &nbsp; 5  But ye say, Whosoever shall say to <I>his</I> father or <I>his</I>
 mother, <I>It is</I> a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
 by me;
 &nbsp; 6  And honour not his father or his mother, <I>he shall be free.</I>
 Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your
 tradition.
 &nbsp; 7  <I>Ye</I> hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
 &nbsp; 8  This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
 honoureth me with <I>their</I> lips; but their heart is far from me.
 &nbsp; 9  But in vain they do worship me, teaching <I>for</I> doctrines the
 commandments of men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Evil manners, we say, beget good laws. The intemperate heat of the 
 Jewish teachers for the support of their hierarchy, occasioned many 
 excellent discourses of our Saviour's for the settling of the truth, as 
 here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here, is the cavil of the scribes and Pharisees at Christ's 
 disciples, for <I>eating with unwashen hands.</I> The scribes and 
 Pharisees were the great men of the Jewish church, men whose gain was 
 godliness, great enemies to the gospel of Christ, but colouring their 
 opposition with a pretence of zeal for the law of Moses, when really 
 nothing was intended but the support of their own tyranny over the 
 consciences of men. They were men of learning and men of business. 
 These scribes and Pharisees here introduced were of Jerusalem, the holy 
 city, the head city, whither <I>the tribes went up,</I> and where 
 <I>were set the thrones of judgment;</I> they should therefore have 
 been better than others, but they were worse. Note, External 
 privileges, if they be not duly improved, commonly swell men up the 
 more with pride and malignity. Jerusalem, which should have been a pure 
 spring, was now become a poisoned sink. <I>How is the faithful city 
 become a harlot!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now if these great men be the accusers, pray what is the accusation? 
 What articles do they exhibit against the disciples of Christ? Why, 
 truly, the thing laid to their charge, is, nonconformity to the canons 
 of their church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 <I>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?</I> 
 This charge they make good in a particular instance; <I>They wash not 
 their hands when they eat bread.</I> A very high misdemeanor! It was a 
 sign that Christ's disciples conducted themselves inoffensively, when 
 this was the worst thing they could charge them with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. What was the <I>tradition of the elders</I>--That people should often
 wash their hands, and always at meat. This they placed a great deal of 
 religion in, supposing that the meat they touched with unwashen hands 
 would be defiling to them. The Pharisees practiced this themselves,
 and with a great deal of strictness imposed it upon others, not under 
 civil penalties, but as matter of conscience, and making it a sin 
 against God if they did not do it. Rabbi Joses determined, "that to eat 
 with unwashen hands is as great a sin as adultery." And Rabbi Akiba 
 being kept a close prisoner, having water sent him both to wash his 
 hands with, and to drink with his meat, the greatest part being 
 accidentally shed, he washed his hands with the remainder, though he 
 left himself none to drink, saying he would rather die than transgress 
 the tradition of the elders. Nay, they would not eat meat with one that 
 did not wash before meat. This mighty zeal in so small a matter would 
 appear very strange, if we did not still see it incident to 
 church-oppressors, not only to be fond of practising their own 
 inventions, but to be furious in pressing their own impositions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was the transgression of this tradition or injunction by the 
 disciples; it seems, they did not wash their hands when they ate bread, 
 which was the more offensive to the Pharisees, because they were men 
 who in other things were strict and conscientious. The custom was 
 innocent enough, and had a decency in its civil use. We read of the 
 water for purifying at the marriage where Christ was present 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:6">John ii. 6</A>),
 
 though Christ turned it into wine, and so put an end to that use of it.
 But when it came to be practised and imposed as a religious rite and 
 ceremony, and such a stress laid upon it, the disciples, though weak in 
 knowledge, yet were so well taught as not to comply with it, or observe 
 it; no not when the scribes and Pharisees had their eye upon them. They 
 had already learned St. Paul's lesson, <I>All things are lawful for 
 me;</I> no doubt, it is lawful to wash before meat; but I will not be 
 brought under the power of any; especially not those who <I>said to 
 their souls, Bow down, that we may go over.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:12">1 Cor. vi. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What was the complaint of the scribes and Pharisees against them. 
 They quarrel with Christ about it, supposing that he allowed them in 
 it, as he did, no doubt, by his own example; "<I>Why do thy disciples 
 transgress</I> the canons of the church? And why dost thou suffer them
 to do it?" It was well that the complaint was made to Christ; for the 
 disciples themselves, though they knew their duty in this case, were 
 perhaps not so well able to give a reason for what they did as were to 
 be wished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is Christ's answer to this cavil, and his justification of the 
 disciples in that which was charged upon them as a transgression. Note, 
 While we stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, 
 he will be sure to bear us out in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two ways Christ replies upon them;</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By way of recrimination, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:3-6"><I>v.</I> 3-6</A>.

 They were spying motes in the eyes of his disciples, but Christ shows
 them a beam in their own. But that which he charges upon them is not 
 barely a recrimination, for it will be no vindication of ourselves to 
 condemn our reprovers; but it is such a censure of their tradition (and 
 the authority of that was what they built their charge upon) as makes 
 not only a non-compliance lawful, but an opposition a duty. That human 
 authority must never be submitted to, which sets up in competition with 
 divine authority.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The charge in general is, <I>You transgress the commandment of God 
 by your tradition.</I> They called it the <I>tradition of the 
 elders,</I> laying stress upon the antiquity of the usage, and the 
 authority of them that imposed it, as the church of Rome does upon 
 fathers and councils; but Christ calls it <I>their</I> tradition. Note, 
 Illegal impositions will be laid to the charge of those who support and 
 maintain them, and keep them up, as well of those who first invented 
 and enjoined them; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:16">Mic. iv. 16</A>.

 <I>You transgress the commandment of God.</I> Note, Those who are most
 zealous of their own impositions, are commonly most careless of God's 
 commands; which is a good reason why Christ's disciples should stand 
 upon their guard against such impositions, lest, though at first they 
 seem only to infringe the liberty of Christians, they come at length to 
 confront the authority of Christ. Though the Pharisees, in this command 
 of washing before meat, did not entrench upon any command of God; yet, 
 because in other instances they did, he justifies his disciples' 
 disobedience to this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The proof of this charge is in particular instance, that of their 
 transgressing the fifth commandment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Let us see what the command of God is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 what the precept, and what the sanction of the law is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The precept is, <I>Honour thy father and thy mother;</I> this is 
 enjoined by the common Father of mankind, and by paying respect to them 
 whom Providence has made the instruments of our being, we give honour 
 to him who is the Author of it, who has thereby, as to us, put some of 
 his image upon them. The whole of children's duty to their parents is 
 included in this of honouring them, which is the spring and foundation 
 of all the rest, <I>If I be a father, where is my honour?</I> Our 
 Saviour here supposes it to mean the duty of children's maintaining 
 their parents, and ministering to their wants, if there be occasion, 
 and being every way serviceable to their comfort. <I>Honour widows,</I> 
 that is, maintain them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:3">1 Tim. v. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The sanction of this law in the fifth commandment, is, a promise, 
 <I>that thy days may be long;</I> but our Saviour waives that, lest any 
 should thence infer it to be only a thing commendable and profitable, 
 and insists upon the penalty annexed to the breach of this commandment 
 in another scripture, which denotes the duty to be highly and 
 indispensably necessary; <I>He that curseth father or mother, let him 
 die the death:</I> this law we have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:17">Exod. xxi. 17</A>.

 The sin of cursing parents is here opposed to the duty of honouring
 them. Those who speak ill of their parents, or wish ill to them, who 
 mock at them, or give them taunting and opprobrious language, break 
 this law. If to call a brother <I>Raca</I> be so penal, what is it to 
 call a father so? By our Saviour's application of this law, it appears, 
 that denying service or relief to parents is included in cursing them. 
 Though the language be respectful enough, and nothing abusive in it, 
 yet what will that avail, if the deeds be not agreeable? it is but like 
 him that said, <I>I go, Sir, and went not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:30"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Let us see what was the contradiction which the tradition of the 
 elders gave to this command. It was not direct and downright, but 
 implicit; their casuists gave them such rules as furnished them with an 
 easy evasion from the obligation of this command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 You hear what God saith, <I>but ye say</I> so and so. Note, That which
 men say, even great men, and learned men, and men in authority, must be 
 examined by that which God saith; and if it be found either contrary or 
 inconsistent, it may and must be rejected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:19">Acts iv. 19</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> What their tradition was; That a man could not in any 
 case bestow his worldly estate better than to give it to the priests, 
 and devote it to the service of the temple: and that when any thing was 
 so devoted, it was not only unlawful to alienate it, but all other 
 obligations, though ever so just and sacred, were thereby superseded, 
 and a man was thereby discharged from them. And this proceeded partly 
 from their ceremoniousness, and the superstitious regard they had to 
 the temple, and partly from their covetousness, and love of money: for 
 what was given to the temple they were gainers by. The former was, in 
 pretence, the latter was, in truth, at the bottom of this 
 tradition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> How they allowed the application of this to the case 
 of children. When their parents' necessities called for their 
 assistance, they pleaded, that all they could spare from themselves and 
 their children, they had devoted to the treasury of the temple; <I>It 
 is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me,</I> and 
 therefore their parents must expect nothing from them; suggesting 
 withal, that the spiritual advantage of what was so devoted, would 
 redound to the parents, who must live upon that air. This, they taught, 
 was a good and valid plea, and many undutiful, unnatural children made 
 use of it, and they justified them in it, and said, <I>He shall be 
 free;</I> so we supply the sense. Some go further, and supply it thus, 
 "<I>He doth well, his days shall be long in the land,</I> and he shall 
 be looked upon as having duly observed the fifth commandment." The 
 pretence of religion would make his refusal to provide for his parents 
 not only passable but plausible. But the absurdity and impiety of this 
 tradition were very evident: for revealed religion was intended to 
 improve, not to overthrow, natural religion; one of the fundamental 
 laws of which is this of honouring our parents; and had they known what 
 that meant, <I>I will have justice, and mercy, and not sacrifice,</I> 
 they had not thus made the most arbitrary rituals destructive of the 
 most necessary morals. This was <I>making the command of God of no 
 effect.</I> Note, Whatever leads to, or countenances, disobedience, 
 does, in effect, make void the command; and they that take upon them to 
 dispense with God's law, do, in Christ's account, repeal and disannul 
 it. To break the law is bad, but to <I>teach men so,</I> as the scribes 
 and Pharisees did, is much worse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:19"><I>ch.</I> v. 19</A>.

 To what purpose is the command given, if it be not obeyed? The rule is,
 as to us, of none effect, if we be not ruled by it. <I>It is time for 
 thee, Lord, to work;</I> high time for the great Reformer, the great 
 Refiner, to appear; for they have <I>made void thy law</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:126">Ps. cxix. 126</A>);

 not only sinned <I>against</I> the commandment, but, as far as in them 
 lay, sinned <I>away</I> the commandment. But, thanks be to God, in 
 spite of them and all their traditions, the command stands in full 
 force, power, and virtue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The other part of Christ's answer is by way of reprehension; and 
 that which he here charges them with, is hypocrisy; <I>Ye 
 hypocrites,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Note, It is the prerogative of him who searcheth the heart, and knows
 what is in man, to pronounce who are hypocrites. The eye of man can
 perceive open profaneness, but it is only the eye of Christ that can 
 discern hypocrisy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:15">Luke xvi. 15</A>.

 And as it is a sin which his eye discovers, so it is a sin which of all
 others his soul hates.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now Christ fetches his reproof from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:13">Isa. xxix. 13</A>.

 <I>Well did Esaias prophesy of you.</I> Isaiah spoke it of the men of
 that generation to which he prophesied, yet Christ applies it to these 
 scribes and Pharisees. Note, The reproofs of sin and sinners, which we 
 find in scripture, were designed to reach the like persons and 
 practices to the end of the world; for they are not of private 
 interpretation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:20">2 Pet. i. 20</A>.

 The sinners of the latter days are prophesied of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:1,2Ti+3:1,2,3:3">1 Tim. iv. 1;
 2 Tim. iii. 1; 2 Pet. iii. 3</A>.

 Threatenings directed against others, belong to us, if we be guilty of
 the same sins. Isaiah prophesied not of them only, but of all other
 hypocrites, against whom that word of his is still levelled, and stands
 in force. The prophecies of scripture are every day in the
 fulfilling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophecy exactly deciphers a hypocritical nation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:17,10:6">Isa. ix. 17; x. 6</A>.
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The description of hypocrites, in two things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] In their own performances of religious worship, v. 8, when they 
 <I>draw nigh to God with their mouth, and honour him with their lips, 
 their heart is far from him.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> How far a hypocrite goes; he draws nigh to God, and 
 honours him; he is, in profession, a worshipper of God. The <I>Pharisee 
 went up to the temple, to pray;</I> he does not stand at that distance 
 which those are at, who <I>live without God in the world,</I> but has a 
 name among the people near unto him. They honour him; that is, they 
 take on them to honour God, they join with those that do so. Some 
 honour God has even from the services of hypocrites, as they help to 
 keep up the face and form of godliness in the world, whence God fetches 
 honour to himself, though they intend it not to him. When God's enemies 
 submit themselves but feignedly, when <I>they lie unto him,</I> so the 
 word is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:3">Ps. lxvi. 3</A>),

 it redounds to his honour, and he <I>gets himself a name.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Where he rests and takes up; this is done gut with his
 mouth and with his lips. It is piety but from the teeth outwards; he 
 shows much love, and that is all, there is in his heart no true love; 
 <I>they make their voices to be heard</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:4">Isa. lviii. 4</A>),

 mention the name of the Lord,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:1">Isa. xlviii. 1</A>.

 Hypocrites are those that only make a lip-labour of religion and 
 religious worship. In word and tongue, the worst hypocrites may do as 
 well as the best saints, and speak as fair with Jacob's voice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> What that is wherein he comes short; it is in the main 
 matter; <I>Their heart is far from me,</I> habitually alienated and 
 estranged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:18">Eph. iv. 18</A>),

 actually wandering and dwelling upon something else; no serious 
 thoughts of God, no pious affections toward him, no concern about the 
 soul and eternity, no thoughts agreeable to the service. God is <I>near 
 in their mouth, but far from their reins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:2,Eze+33:31">Jer. xii. 2; Ezek. xxxiii. 31</A>.

 The heart, with the <I>fool's eyes, is in the ends of the earth.</I> It 
 is a silly dove that is without a heart, and so it is a <I>silly 
 duty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:11">Hos. vii. 11</A>.

 A hypocrite says one thing, but thinks another. The great thing that
 God looks at and requires is the heart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:26">Prov. xxiii. 26</A>);

 if that be far from him, it is not a reasonable service and therefore 
 not an acceptable one; it is the sacrifice of fools, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:1">Eccl. v. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] In their prescriptions to others. This is an instance of their 
 hypocrisy, that <I>they teach for doctrines the commandments of 
 men.</I> The Jews then, as the papists since, paid the same respect to 
 oral tradition that they did to the word of God, receiving it <I>pari 
 pietatis affectu ac reverenti&acirc;--with the same pious affection and
 reverence.</I> Conc. Trident. <I>Sess.</I> 4. <I>Decr.</I> 

 1. When men's inventions are tacked to God's institutions, and imposed
 accordingly, this is hypocrisy, a mere human religion. The commandments 
 of men are properly conversant about the things of men, but God will 
 have his own work done by his own rules, and accepts not that which he 
 did not himself appoint. That only cones <I>to</I> him, that comes 
 <I>from</I> him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The doom of hypocrites; it is put in a little compass; <I>In vain 
 do they worship me.</I> Their worship does not attain the end for which 
 it was appointed; it will neither please God, nor profit themselves. If 
 it be not <I>in spirit,</I> it is not <I>in truth,</I> and so it is all 
 nothing. That man who only <I>seems</I> to be religious, but is not so, 
 his <I>religion is vain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:26">James i. 26</A>);

 and if our religion be a vain oblation, a vain religion, <I>how great 
 is that vanity!</I> How sad is it to live in an age of prayers and 
 sermons, and sabbaths and sacraments, <I>in vain,</I> to <I>beat the 
 air in</I> all these; it is so, if the heart be not with God in them. 
 Lip-labour is lost labour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11">Isa. i. 11</A>.

 Hypocrites sow the wind and reap the whirlwind; they trust in vanity,
 and vanity will be their recompence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus Christ justified his disciples in their disobedience to the 
 traditions of the elders; and this the scribes and Pharisees got by 
 their cavilling. We read not of any reply they made; if they were not 
 satisfied, yet they were silenced, and could not resist the power 
 wherewith Christ spake.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
 understand:
 &nbsp; 11  Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
 which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
 &nbsp; 12  Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou
 that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
 &nbsp; 13  But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly
 Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
 &nbsp; 14  Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if
 the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
 &nbsp; 15  Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
 parable.
 &nbsp; 16  And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
 &nbsp; 17  Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the
 mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
 &nbsp; 18  But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
 from the heart; and they defile the man.
 &nbsp; 19  For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders,
 adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
 &nbsp; 20  These are <I>the things</I> which defile a man: but to eat with
 unwashen hands defileth not a man.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ having proved that the disciples, in eating with unwashen hands, 
 were not to be blamed, as transgressing the traditions and injunctions 
 of the elders, comes here to show that they were not to be blamed, as 
 having done any thing that was in itself evil. In the former part of 
 his discourse he overturned the authority of the law, and in this the 
 reason of it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The solemn introduction to this discourse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 <I>He called the multitude.</I> They were withdrawn while Christ 
 discoursed with the scribes and Pharisees; probably those proud men 
 ordered them to withdraw, as not willing to talk with Christ in their 
 hearing; Christ must favour them at their pleasure with a discourse in 
 private. But Christ had a regard to the multitude; he soon despatched 
 the scribes and Pharisees, and then turned them off, invited the mob, 
 the multitude, to be his hearers: thus the poor are evangelized; and 
 the foolish things of the world, and things that are despised hath 
 Christ chosen. The humble Jesus embraced those whom the proud Pharisees 
 looked upon with disdain, and to them he designed it for a 
 mortification. He turns from them as wilful and unteachable, and turns 
 to the multitude, who, though weak, were humble, and willing to be 
 taught. To them he said, <I>Hear and understand.</I> Note, What we hear 
 from the mouth of Christ, we must give all diligence to understand. Not 
 only scholars, but even the multitude, the ordinary people, must apply 
 their minds to understand the words of Christ. He <I>therefore</I> 
 calls upon them to understand, because the lesson he was now about to 
 teach them, was contrary to the notions which they had sucked in with 
 their milk from their teachers; and overturned many of the customs and 
 usages which they were wedded to, and laid stress upon. Note, There is 
 need of a great attention of mind and clearness of understanding to 
 free men from those corrupt principles and practices which they have 
 been bred up in and long accustomed to; for in that case the 
 understanding is commonly bribed and biassed by prejudice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The truth itself laid down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 in two propositions, which were opposite to the vulgar errors of that 
 time, and were therefore surprising.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Not that which goes into the mouth defileth the man.</I> It is 
 not the kind or quality of our food, nor the condition of our hands, 
 that affects the soul with any moral pollution or defilement. <I>The 
 kingdom of God is not meat and drink,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:17">Rom. xiv. 17</A>.

 That defiles the man, by which guilt is contracted before God, and the
 man is rendered offensive to him, and disfitted for communion with him; 
 now what we eat, if we do not eat unreasonably and immoderately, does 
 not this; for <I>to the pure all things are pure,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15">Tit. i. 15</A>.

 The Pharisees carried the ceremonial pollutions, by eating such and
 such meats, much further than the law intended, and burdened it with 
 additions of their own, which our Saviour witnesses against; intending 
 hereby to pave the way to a repeal of the ceremonial law in that 
 matter. He was now beginning to teach his followers to <I>call nothing 
 common or unclean;</I> and if Peter, when he was bid to <I>kill and 
 eat,</I> had remembered this word, he would not have said, <I>Not so, 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:13-15,28">Acts x. 13-15, 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>But that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.</I> We 
 are polluted, not by the meat we eat with unwashen hands, but by the 
 words we speak from an unsanctified heart; thus it is that <I>the mouth 
 causeth the flesh to sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:6">Eccl. v. 6</A>.

 Christ, in a former discourse, had laid a great stress upon our
 <I>words</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:36,37"><I>ch.</I> xii. 36, 37</A>);

 and that was intended for reproof and warning to those that cavilled at
 him; this here is intended for reproof and warning to those that 
 cavilled at the disciples, and censured them. It is not the disciples 
 that defile themselves with what they eat, but the Pharisees that 
 defile themselves with what they speak spitefully and censoriously of 
 them. Note, Those who charge guilt upon others for transgressing the 
 commandments of men, many times bring greater guilt upon themselves, by 
 transgressing the law of God against rash judging. Those most defile
 themselves, who are most forward to censure the defilements of 
 others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The offence that was taken at this truth and the account brought 
 to Christ of that offence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 "<I>The disciples said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were 
 offended,</I> and didst thou not foresee that they would be so, <I>at 
 this saying,</I> and would think the worse of thee and of thy doctrine 
 for it, and be the more enraged at thee?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was not strange that the Pharisees should be offended at this 
 plain truth, for they were men made up of error and enmity, mistakes 
 and malice. Sore eyes cannot bear clear light; and nothing is more 
 provoking to proud imposers than the undeceiving of those whom they 
 have first blindfolded, and then enslaved. It should seem that the 
 Pharisees, who were strict observers of the traditions, were more 
 offended than the scribes, who were the teachers of them; and perhaps 
 they were as much galled with the latter part of Christ's doctrine, 
 which taught a strictness in the government of our tongue, as with the 
 former part, which taught an indifference about washing our hands; 
 great contenders for the formalities of religion, being commonly as 
 great contemners of the substantials of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The disciples thought it strange that their Master should say that 
 which he knew would give so much offence; he did not use to do so: 
 surely, they think, if he had considered how provoking it would be, he 
 would not have said it. But he knew what he said, and to whom he said 
 it, and what would be the effect of it; and would teach us, that though 
 in indifferent things we must be tender of giving offence, yet we must 
 not, for fear of that, evade any truth or duty. Truth must be owned, 
 and duty done; and if any be offended, it is his own fault; it is 
 scandal, not given, but taken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Perhaps the disciples themselves stumbled at the word Christ said, 
 which they thought bold, and scarcely reconcileable with the difference 
 that was put by the law of God between <I>clean</I> and <I>unclean</I> 
 meats; and therefore objected this to Christ, that they might 
 themselves be better informed. They seem likewise to have a concern 
 upon them for the Pharisees, though they had quarrelled with them; 
 which teaches us to forgive, and seek the good, especially the 
 spiritual good, of our enemies, persecutors, and slanderers. They would 
 not have the Pharisees go away displeased at any thing Christ had said; 
 and therefore, though they do not desire him to retract it, they hope 
 he will explain, correct, and modify it. Weak hearers are sometimes 
 more solicitous than they should be not to have wicked hearers 
 offended. But if we please men with the concealment of truth, and the 
 indulgence of their errors and corruptions, we are not the servants of 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The doom passed upon the Pharisees and their corrupt traditions; 
 which comes in as a reason why Christ cared not though he offended 
 them, and therefore why the disciples should not care; because they 
 were a generation of men that hated to be reformed, and were marked out 
 for destruction. Two things Christ here foretels concerning them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The rooting out of them and their traditions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 <I>Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be 
 rooted up.</I> Not only the corrupt opinions and superstitious 
 practices of the Pharisees, but their sect, and way, and constitution, 
 were plants not of God's planting. The rules of their profession were 
 no institutions of his, but owed their origin to pride and formality. 
 The people of the Jews were planted <I>a noble vine;</I> but now that 
 they are become the degenerate plant of a strange vine, God disowned 
 them, as not of his planting. Note, 

 (1.) In the visible church, it is no strange thing to find plants that 
 our heavenly Father has not planted. It is implied, that whatever is 
 good in the church is of God's planting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:19">Isa. xli. 19</A>.

 But let the husbandman be ever so careful, his ground will cast forth
 weeds of itself, more or less, and there is an enemy busy sowing tares.
 What is corrupt, though of God's permitting, is not of his planting; he 
 sows nothing but <I>good seed in his field.</I> Let us not therefore be 
 deceived, as if all must needs be right that we find in the church, and 
 all those persons and things our Father's plants that we find in our 
 Father's garden. <I>Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits;</I> 
 see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:5,23:31,32">Jer. xix. 5; xxiii. 31, 32</A>.

 (2.) Those that are of the spirit of the Pharisees, proud, formal, and
 imposing, what figure soever they make, and of what denomination soever 
 they be, God will not own them as of his planting. <I>By their fruit 
 you shall know them.</I> 

 (3.) Those plants that are not of God's planting, shall not be of his 
 protecting, but shall undoubtedly be rooted up. What is not of God 
 shall not stand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:38">Acts v. 38</A>.

 What things are unscriptural, will wither and die of themselves, or be
 justly exploded by the churches; however in the great day these tares 
 that offend will be bundled for the fire. What is become of the
 Pharisees and their traditions? They are long since abandoned; but the 
 gospel of truth is great, and will remain. It cannot be rooted up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The ruin of them; and their followers, who had their persons and 
 principles in admiration, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Where,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ bids his disciples <I>let them alone.</I> "Have no converse 
 with them or concern for them; neither court their favour, nor dread 
 their displeasure; care not though they be offended, they will take 
 their course, and let them take the issue of it. They are wedded to 
 their own fancies, and will have every thing their own way; let them 
 alone. Seek not to please a generation of men that please not God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15">1 Thess. ii. 15</A>),

 and will be pleased with nothing less than absolute dominion over your 
 consciences. They are <I>joined to idols,</I> as Ephraim 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:17">Hos. iv. 17</A>),
 
 the idols of their own fancy; <I>let them alone, let them be filthy 
 still,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:11">Rev. xxii. 11</A>.

 The case of those sinners is sad indeed, whom Christ orders his
 ministers to let alone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He gives them two reasons for it. <I>Let them alone;</I> for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They are proud and ignorant; two bad qualities that often meet, 
 and render a man incurable in his folly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:12">Prov. xxvi. 12</A>.

 <I>They are blind leaders of the blind.</I> They are grossly ignorant
 in the things of God, and strangers to the spiritual nature of the 
 divine law; and yet so proud, that they think they see better and 
 further than any, and therefore undertake to be leaders of others, to 
 show others the way to heaven, when they themselves know not one step 
 of the way; and, accordingly, they prescribe to all, and proscribe 
 those who will not follow them. Though they were blind, if they had 
 owned it, and come to Christ for eye-salve, they might have seen, but 
 they disdained the intimation of such a thing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:40">John ix. 40</A>);

 <I>Are we blind also?</I> They were confident that <I>they themselves 
 were guides of the blind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:19,20">Rom. ii. 19, 20</A>),

 were appointed to be so, and fit to be so; that every thing they said 
 was an oracle and a law; "Therefore <I>let them alone,</I> their case 
 is desperate; do not meddle with them; you may soon provoke them, but 
 never convince them." How miserable was the case of the Jewish Church 
 now when their leaders were blind, so self-conceitedly foolish, as to 
 be peremptory in their conduct, while the people were so sottishly 
 foolish as to follow them with an implicit faith and obedience, and 
 <I>willingly walk after the commandment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:11">Hos. v. 11</A>.

 Now the prophecy was fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:10,14">Isa. xxix. 10, 14</A>.

 And it is easy to imagine <I>what will be in the end hereof,</I> when
 <I>the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their 
 means, and the people love to have it so,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:31">Jer. v. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They are posting to destruction, and will shortly be plunged into 
 it; <I>Both shall fall into the ditch.</I> This must needs be the end 
 of it, if both be so blind, and yet both so bold, venturing forward, 
 and yet not aware of danger. Both will be involved in the general 
 desolation coming upon the Jews, and both drowned in eternal 
 destruction and perdition. The blind leaders and the blind followers 
 will perish together. We find 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:15">Rev. xxii. 15</A>),

 that hell is the portion of those that <I>make a lie,</I> and of those 
 that <I>love</I> it when it is made. <I>The deceived and the 
 deceiver</I> are obnoxious to the judgment of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:16">Job xii. 16</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> Those that by their cunning craftiness draw others
 to sin and error, shall not, with all their craft and cunning, escape 
 ruin themselves. If <I>both fall together into the ditch,</I> the blind 
 leaders will fall undermost, and have the worst of it; see 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:15,16">Jer. xiv. 15, 16</A>.

 <I>The prophets shall be consumed first,</I> and then the <I>people to
 whom they prophesy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:6,27:15,16">Jer. xx. 6; xxvii. 15, 16</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> The sin and ruin of the deceivers will be no security
 to those that are deceived by them. Though the leaders of this people
 <I>cause them to err,</I> yet they that are <I>led of them are 
 destroyed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:16">Isa. ix. 16</A>),

 because they shut their eyes against the light which would have 
 rectified their mistake. Seneca, complaining of most people's being led 
 by common opinion and practice (<I>Unusquisque mavult credere quam 
 judicare--Things are taken upon trust, and never examined</I>), 
 concludes, <I>Indeista tanta coacervatio aliorum super alios 
 ruentium--Hence crowds fall upon crowds, in vast confusion.</I> De 
 Vit&acirc; Beat&acirc;. The falling of both together will aggravate
 the fall of both; for they that have thus mutually increased each 
 other's sin, will mutually exasperate each other's ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Instruction given to the disciples concerning the truth Christ had 
 laid down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Though Christ rejects the wilfully ignorant who care not to be taught,
 he can have compassion on the ignorant who are willing to learn,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:2">Heb. v. 2</A>.

 If the Pharisees, who made void the law, be offended, let them be
 offended: but this <I>great peace have they who love the law,</I> that 
 <I>nothing shall offend them,</I> but, some way or other, the offence 
 shall be taken off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:165">Ps. cxix. 165</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 1. Their desire to be better instructed in this matter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 in this request as in many others, Peter was their speaker; the rest, 
 it is probable, putting him on to speak, or intimating their 
 concurrence; <I>Declare unto us this parable.</I> What Christ said was 
 plain, but, because it agreed not with the notions they had imbibed, 
 though they would not contradict it, yet they call it a parable, and 
 cannot understand it. Note, 

 (1.) Weak understandings are apt to turn plain truths into parables, 
 and to seek for a knot in a bulrush. The disciples often did so, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:17">John xvi. 17</A>.

 Even the grasshopper is a burthen to a weak stomach, and babes in
 understanding cannot bear and digest strong meat.

 (2.) Where a weak head doubts concerning any word of Christ, an upright 
 heart and a willing mind will seek for instruction. The Pharisees were
 offended, but kept it to themselves; hating to be reformed, they hated 
 to be informed; but the disciples, though offended, sought for 
 satisfaction, imputing the offence, not to the doctrine delivered, but 
 to the shallowness of their own capacity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reproof Christ gave them for their weakness and ignorance 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 <I>Are ye also yet without understanding?</I> As many as Christ loves 
 and teaches, he thus rebukes. Note, They are very ignorant indeed, who 
 understand not that moral pollutions are abundantly worse and more 
 dangerous than ceremonial ones. Two things aggravate their dulness and 
 darkness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they were the disciples of Christ; "Are <I>ye</I> also 
 without understanding? Ye whom I have admitted into so great a degree 
 of familiarity with me, are ye so unskilful in the word of 
 righteousness?" Note, The ignorance and mistakes of those that profess 
 religion, and enjoy the privileges of church-membership, are justly a 
 grief to the Lord Jesus. "No wonder that the Pharisees understand not 
 this doctrine, who know nothing of the Messiah's kingdom: but ye that 
 have heard of it, and embraced it yourselves, and preached it to 
 others, are ye also such strangers to the spirit and genius of it?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they had been a great while Christ's scholars; "Are ye 
 <I>yet</I> so, after ye have been so long under my teaching?" Had they 
 been but of yesterday in Christ's school, it had been another matter, 
 but to have been for so many months Christ's constant hearers, and yet 
 to be without understanding, was a great reproach to them. Note, Christ 
 expects from us some proportion of knowledge, and grace, and wisdom, 
 according to the time and means we have had. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:9,Heb+5:12,2Ti+3:7,8">John xiv. 9; 
 Heb. v. 12; 2 Tim. iii. 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The explication Christ gave them of this doctrine of pollutions. 
 Though he chid them for their dulness, he did not cast them off, but 
 pitied them, and taught them, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:25-27">Luke xxiv. 25-27</A>.

 He here shows us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What little danger we are in of pollution from that which 
 <I>entereth in at the mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 An inordinate appetite, intemperance, and excess in eating, come out of
 the heart, and are defiling; but meat in itself is not so, as the 
 Pharisees supposed. What there is of dregs and defilement in our meat, 
 nature (or rather God of nature) has provided a way to clear us of it; 
 <I>it goes in at the belly, and is cast out into the draught,</I> and 
 nothing remains to us but pure nourishment. So <I>fearfully</I> and 
 <I>wonderfully are we made</I> and preserved, and our souls held in 
 life. The expulsive faculty is as necessary in the body as any other, 
 for the discharge of that which is superfluous, or noxious; so happily 
 is nature enabled to help itself, and shift for its own good: by this 
 means nothing defiles; if we eat with unwashen hands, and so any thing 
 unclean mix with our food, nature will separate it, and cast it out, 
 and it will be no defilement to us. It may be a piece of cleanliness, 
 but it is not point of conscience, to wash before meat; and we go upon 
 a great mistake if we place religion in it. It is not the practice 
 itself, but the opinion it is built upon, that Christ condemns, as if 
 meat commended us to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:8">1 Cor. viii. 8</A>);

 whereas Christianity stands not in such observances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What great danger we are in of pollution from that which 
 <I>proceeds out of the mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 out of the abundance of the heart: compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:34"><I>ch.</I> xii. 34</A>.

 There is no defilement in the products of God's bounty; the defilement
 arises from the products of out corruption. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The corrupt fountain of that which proceeds out of the mouth; it 
 comes from the heart; that is the spring and source of all sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:7">Jer. viii. 7</A>.
 
 It is the heart that is so desperately wicked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:9">Jer. xvii. 9</A>);

 for there is no sin in a word or deed, which was not first in the
 heart. There is the root of bitterness, which <I>bears gall and
 wormwood.</I> It is the inward part of a sinner, that is very 
 wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:9">Ps. v. 9</A>.

 All evil speakings come forth from the heart, and are defiling; from
 the corrupt heart comes the corrupt communication.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Some of the corrupt streams which flow from this fountain, 
 specified; though they do not all <I>come out of the mouth,</I> yet 
 they all come out of the man, and are the fruits of that wickedness 
 which is in the heart, and is wrought there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:2">Ps. lviii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First, Evil thoughts,</I> sins against all the commandments. 
 Therefore David puts vain thoughts in opposition to the whole law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:113">Ps. cxix. 113</A>.

 These are the first-born of the corrupt nature, the beginning of its
 strength, and do most resemble it. These, as the son and heir,
 <I>abide in the house, and lodge within us.</I> There is a great deal 
 of sin that begins and ends in the heart, and goes no further. Carnal 
 fancies and imaginations are evil thoughts, wickedness in the 
 contrivance (<B><I>Dialogismoi poneroi</I></B>), wicked plots, 
 purposes, and devices of mischief to others,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly, Murders,</I> sins against the sixth commandment; these 
 come from a malice in the heart against our brother's life, or a 
 contempt of it. Hence he <I>that hates his brother,</I> is said to be a 
 <I>murderer;</I> he is so at God's bar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:15">1 John iii. 15</A>.

 <I>War is in the heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:21,Jam+4:1">Ps. iv. 21; James iv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly, Adulteries and fornications,</I> sins against the seventh 
 commandment; these come from the wanton, unclean, carnal heart; and the 
 lust that reigns there, is conceived there, and brings forth these 
 sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:15">James i. 15</A>.

 There is adultery in the heart first, and then in the act,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:28"><I>ch.</I> v. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly, Thefts,</I> sins against the eighth commandment; cheats, 
 wrongs, rapines, and all injurious contracts; the fountain of all these 
 is in the heart, that is it that is <I>exercised in these covetous 
 practices</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:14">2 Pet. ii. 14</A>),

 that is set upon riches, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:10">Ps. lxii. 10</A>.

 <I>Achan coveted, and then took,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fifthly, False witness,</I> against the ninth commandment; this 
 comes from a complication of falsehood and covetousness, or falsehood 
 and covetousness, or falsehood and malice in the heart. If truth, 
 holiness, and love, which God <I>requires in the inward parts,</I> 
 reigned as they ought, there would be no false witness bearing, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:6,Jer+9:8">Ps. lxiv. 6; Jer. ix. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Sixthly, Blasphemies,</I> speaking evil of God, against the third 
 commandment; speaking evil of our neighbour, against the ninth 
 commandment; these come from a contempt and disesteem of both in the 
 heart; thence <I>the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost</I> proceeds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:31,32"><I>ch.</I> xii. 31, 32</A>);

 these are the overflowing of the gall within.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now <I>these are the things which defile a man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Note, Sin is defiling to the soul, renders it unlovely and abominable
 in the eyes of a pure and holy God; unfit for communion with him, and 
 for the enjoyment of him in the new Jerusalem, into which nothing shall 
 enter that defileth or worketh iniquity. The mind and conscience are 
 defiled by sin, and that makes every thing else so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15">Tit. i. 15</A>.

 This defilement by sin was signified by the ceremonial pollutions which
 the Jewish doctors added to, but understood not. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:13,14,1Jo+1:7">Heb. ix. 13, 14; 1 John i. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These therefore are the things we must carefully avoid, and all 
 approaches toward them, and not lay stress upon the washing of the 
 hands. Christ doth not yet repeal the law of the distinction of meats 
 (that was not done till 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:9-16">Acts x.</A>),

 but the tradition of the elders, which was tacked to that law; and
 therefore he concludes, <I>To eat with unwashen hands</I> (which was 
 the matter now in question), <I>this defileth not a man.</I> If he 
 wash, he is not the better before God; if he wash not, he is not the 
 worse.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre
 and Sidon.
 &nbsp; 22  And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
 and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <I>thou</I> Son
 of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
 &nbsp; 23  But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
 besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
 &nbsp; 24  But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost
 sheep of the house of Israel.
 &nbsp; 25  Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
 &nbsp; 26  But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the
 children's bread, and to cast <I>it</I> to dogs.
 &nbsp; 27  And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
 which fall from their masters' table.
 &nbsp; 28  Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great <I>is</I>
 thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter
 was made whole from that very hour.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here that famous story of Christ's <I>casting the devil out of 
 the woman of Canaan's daughter;</I> it has something in it singular and 
 very surprising, and which looks favourably upon the poor Gentiles, and 
 is an earnest of the mercy which Christ had in store for them. Here is 
 a gleam of that <I>light</I> which was <I>to lighten the Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:32">Luke ii. 32</A>.

 Christ <I>came to his own, and his own received him not;</I> but many
 of them quarrelled with him, and were offended in him; and observe what 
 follows,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>Jesus went thence.</I> Note, Justly is the light taken from those 
 that either play by it, or rebel against it. When Christ and his 
 disciples could not be quiet among them, he left them, and so left an 
 example to his own rule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:14"><I>ch.</I> x. 14</A>),

 <I>Shake off the dust of your feet.</I> Though Christ endure long, he
 will not always <I>endure, the contradiction of sinners against
 himself.</I> He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>Let them alone,</I> and he did so. Note, Wilful prejudices against
 the gospel, and cavils at it, often provoke Christ to withdraw, and 
 <I>to remove the candlestick out of its place.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:46,51">Acts xiii. 46, 51</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When he went thence, he <I>departed into the coasts of Tyre and 
 Sidon;</I> not to those cities (they were excluded from any share in 
 <I>Christ's mighty works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:21,22"><I>ch.</I> xi. 21, 22</A>),

 but into that part of the land of Israel which lay that way: thither he
 went, as Elias <I>to Sarepta, a city of Sidon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:26">Luke iv. 26</A>);

 thither he went to look after this poor woman, whom he had mercy in 
 reserve for. While he went about doing good, he was never out of his 
 way. The dark corners of the country, which lay most remote, shall have 
 their share of his benign influences; and as now <I>the ends of the 
 land,</I> so afterward <I>the ends of the earth, shall see his 
 salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:6">Isa. xlix. 6</A>.

 Here it was, that this miracle was wrought, in the story of which we
 may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The address of the woman of Canaan to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 She was a Gentile, <I>a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel;</I>
 probably one of the posterity of those accursed nations that were 
 devoted by that word, <I>Cursed be Canaan.</I> Note, The doom of 
 political bodies doth not always reach every individual member of them. 
 God will have his remnant out of all nations, chosen vessels in all 
 coasts, even the most unlikely: she came out of the same coasts. If 
 Christ had not now made a visit to these coasts, though the mercy was 
 worth travelling far for, it is probable that she had never come to 
 him. Note, It is often an excitement to a dormant faith and zeal, to 
 have opportunities of acquaintance with Christ brought to our doors, to 
 have the word nigh us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Her address was very importunate, she <I>cried</I> to Christ, as one in 
 earnest; cried, as being at some distance from him, not daring to 
 approach too near, being a Canaanite, lest she should give offence. In 
 her address,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) She relates her misery; <I>My daughter is grievously vexed with a 
 devil,</I> <B><I>kakos daimonizetai</I></B>--<I>She is
 ill-bewitched,</I> or <I>possessed.</I> There were degrees of that 
 misery, and this was the worst sort. It was common case at that time, 
 and very calamitous. Note, The vexations of children are the trouble of 
 parents, and nothing should be more so than their being under the power 
 of Satan. Tender parents very sensibly feel the miseries of those that 
 are pieces of themselves. "Though vexed with the devil, yet she is my 
 daughter still." The greatest afflictions of our relations do not 
 dissolve our obligations to them, and therefore ought not to alienate 
 our affections from them. It was the distress and trouble of her 
 family, that now brought her to Christ; she came to him, not for 
 teaching, but for healing; yet, because she came in faith, he did not 
 reject her. Though it is need that drives us to Christ, yet we shall 
 not therefore be driven from him. It was the affliction o her daughter, 
 that gave her this occasion of applying to Christ. It is good to make 
 the afflictions of others our own, in sense and sympathy, that we may 
 make them our own, in improvement and advantage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) She requests for mercy; <I>Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of 
 David,</I> she owns him to be the Messiah: that is the great thing 
 which faith should fasten upon, and fetch comfort from. From the Lord 
 we may expect acts of power: he can command deliverances; from the Son 
 of David we may expect all the mercy and grace which were foretold 
 concerning him. Though a Gentile, she owns <I>the promise made to the 
 fathers</I> of the Jews, and the honour of the house of David. The 
 Gentiles must receive Christianity, not only as an improvement of 
 natural religion, but as the perfection of the Jewish religion, with an 
 eye to the Old Testament.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Her petition is, <I>Have mercy on me.</I> She does not limit Christ to 
 this or that particular instance of mercy, but mercy, mercy is the 
 thing she begs: she pleads not merit, but depends upon mercy; <I>Have 
 mercy upon me.</I> Mercies to the children are mercies to the parents; 
 favours to ours are favours to us, and are so to be accounted. Note, It 
 is the duty of parents to pray for their children, and to be earnest in 
 prayer for them, especially for their souls; "I have a son, a daughter, 
 grievously vexed with a proud will, an unclean devil, a malicious 
 devil, led captive by him at his will; <I>Lord, help them.</I>" This is 
 a case more deplorable than that of a bodily possession. Bring them to 
 Christ by faith and prayer, who alone is able to heal them. Parents 
 should look upon it as a great mercy to themselves, to have Satan's 
 power broken in the souls of their children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The discouragement she met with in this address; in all the story of 
 Christ's ministry we do not meet with the like. He was wont to 
 countenance and encourage all that came to him, and either <I>to answer 
 before they called,</I> or <I>to hear while they were yet speaking;</I> 
 but here was one otherwise treated: and what could be the reason of it? 
 
 (1.) Some think that Christ showed himself backward to gratify this 
 poor woman, because he would not give offence to the Jews, by being as 
 free and forward in his favour to the Gentiles as to them. He had bid 
 his disciples <I>not go into the way of the Gentiles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:5"><I>ch.</I> x. 5</A>),

 and therefore would not himself seem so inclinable to them as to 
 others, but rather more shy. Or rather, 

 (2.) Christ treated her thus, to try her; he knows what is in the
 heart, knew the strength of her faith, and how well able she was, by 
 his grace, to break through such discouragements; he <I>therefore</I> 
 met her with them, <I>that the trial of her faith might be found unto 
 praise, and honour, and glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:6,7">1 Pet. i. 6, 7</A>.

 This was like God's tempting Abraham

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:1">Gen. xxii. 1</A>),

 like the angel's wrestling with Jacob, only to put him upon wrestling, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:24">Gen. xxxii. 24</A>.

 Many of the methods of Christ's providence, and especially of his
 grace, in dealing with his people, which are dark and perplexing, may 
 be explained with the key of this story, which is for that end left 
 upon record, to teach us that there may be love in his face, and to 
 encourage us, therefore, <I>though he slay us, yet to trust in 
 him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe the particular discouragements given her:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] When she cried after him, <I>he answered her not a word,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 His ear was wont to be always open and attentive to the cries of poor
 supplicants, and his lips, which dropped as the honeycomb, always ready 
 to give an answer of peace; but to this poor woman he turned a deaf 
 ear, and she could get neither an alms nor an answer. It was a wonder 
 that she did not fly off in a fret, and say, "Is this he that is so 
 famed for clemency and tenderness? Have so many been heard and answered 
 by him, as they talk, and must I be the first rejected suitor? Why so
 distant to me, if it be true that he hath stooped to so many?" But 
 Christ knew what he did, and <I>therefore</I> did not answer, that she 
 might be the more earnest in prayer. He heard her, and was pleased with 
 her, and <I>strengthened her with strength in her soul</I> to prosecute 
 her request

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:3,Job+23:6">Ps. cxxxviii. 3; Job xxiii. 6</A>),

 though he did not immediately give her the answer she expected. By 
 seeming to draw away the desired mercy from her, he drew her on to be 
 so much the more importunate for it. Note, Every accepted prayer is not 
 immediately an answered prayer. Sometimes God seems not to regard his 
 people's prayers, like a man asleep or astonished 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:23,Jer+14:9,Ps+22:1,2">Ps. xliv. 23; 
 Jer. xiv. 9; Ps. xxii. 1, 2</A>);
 
 nay, to be angry at them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:4,La+3:8,44">Ps. lxxx. 4; Lam. iii. 8, 44</A>);

 but it is to prove, and so to <I>improve,</I> their faith, and to make 
 his after-appearances for them the more glorious to himself, and the 
 more welcome to them; for <I>the vision, at the end, shall speak, and 
 shall not lie,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:3">Heb. ii. 3</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:14">Job xxxv. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] When the disciples spake a good word for her, he gave a reason why 
 he refused her, which was yet more discouraging.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> It was some little relief, that the disciples interposed 
 on her behalf; they said, <I>Send her away, for she crieth after 
 us.</I> It is desirable to have an interest in the prayers of good 
 people, and we should be desirous of it. But the disciples, though 
 wishing she might have what she came for, yet therein consulted rather 
 their own ease than the poor woman's satisfaction; "<I>Send her 
 away</I> with a cure, <I>for she cries,</I> and is in good earnest; 
 <I>she cries after us,</I> and is troublesome to us, and shames us." 
 Continued importunity may be uneasy to men, even to good men; but 
 Christ loves to be cried after.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Christ's answer to the disciples quite dashed her 
 expectations; "<I>I am not sent, but to the lost sheep of the house of 
 Israel;</I> you know I am not, she is none of them, and would you have 
 me go beyond by commission?" Importunity seldom conquers the settled 
 reason of a wise man; and those refusals are most silencing, which are 
 so backed. He doth not only not answer her, but he argues against her, 
 and stops her mouth with a reason. It is true, she is a <I>lost 
 sheep,</I> and hath as much need of his care as any, but she is not 
 <I>of the house of Israel,</I> to whom he was first sent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:26">Acts iii. 26</A>),
 
 and therefore not immediately interested in it, and entitled to it. 
 Christ was <I>a Minister of the circumcision</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:8">Rom. xv. 8</A>);

 and though he was intended for <I>a Light to the Gentiles, yet the 
 fulness of time</I> for that <I>was</I> not now <I>come, the veil 
 was</I> not yet <I>rent,</I> nor <I>the partition-wall taken down.</I> 
 Christ's personal ministry was <I>to be the glory of his people 
 Israel;</I> "If I am sent to them, what have I to do with those that 
 are none of them." Note, It is a great trial, when we have occasion 
 given us to question whether we be of those to whom Christ was sent. 
 But, blessed be God, no room is left for that doubt; the distinction 
 between Jew and Gentile is taken away; we are sure that he <I>gave his 
 life a ransom for many,</I> and if for many, why not for me?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> When she continued her importunity, he insisted upon 
 the unfitness of the thing, and gave her not only a repulse, but a 
 seeming reproach too 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 <I>It is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it to 
 dogs.</I> This seems to cut her off from all hope, and might have 
 driven her to despair, if she had not had a very strong faith indeed. 
 Gospel grace and miraculous cures (the appurtenances of it), were 
 children's bread; they belonged to them <I>to whom pertained the 
 adoption</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>),

 and lay not upon the same level with that rain from heaven, and those 
 fruitful seasons, which God gave to the nations whom he suffered <I>to 
 walk in their own ways</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:16,17">Acts xiv. 16, 17</A>);

 no, these were peculiar favours, appropriated to the peculiar people, 
 the garden enclosed. Christ preached to the Samaritans
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:41">John iv. 41</A>),

 but we read not of any cures he wrought among them; <I>that salvation 
 was of the Jews:</I> it is not meet therefore to alienate these. The 
 Gentiles were looked upon by the Jews with great contempt, were called 
 and counted <I>dogs;</I> and, in comparison with the house of Israel, 
 who were so dignified and privileged, Christ here seems to allow it, 
 and therefore thinks it not meet that the Gentiles should share in the 
 favours bestowed on the Jews. But see how the tables are turned; after 
 the bringing of the Gentiles into the church, the Jewish zealots for 
 the law are called <I>dogs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:2">Phil. iii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this Christ urgeth against this woman of Canaan; "How can she 
 expect to eat of the children's bread, who is not of the family?" Note, 
 
 1. Those whom Christ intends most signally to honour, he first humbles
 and lays low in a sense of their own meanness and unworthiness. We must 
 first see ourselves to be as dogs, <I>less than the least of all God's 
 mercies,</I> before we are fit to be dignified and privileged with 
 them. 

 2. Christ delights to exercise great faith with great trials, and
 sometimes reserves the sharpest for the last, that, <I>being tried, we 
 may come forth like gold.</I> This general rule is applicable to other 
 cases for direction, though here used only for trial. Special 
 ordinances and church-privileges are children's bread, and must not be 
 prostituted to the grossly ignorant and profane. Common charity must be 
 extended to all, but spiritual dignities are appropriated to the 
 household of faith; and therefore promiscuous admission to them, 
 without distinction, wastes the children's bread, and is the <I>giving 
 of that which is holy to the dogs,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:6"><I>ch.</I> vii. 6</A>.

 <I>Procul hinc, procul inde, profani--Off, ye profane.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is the strength of her faith and resolution, in breaking 
 through all these discouragements. Many a one, thus tried, would either 
 have sunk into silence, or broken out into passion. "Here is cold 
 comfort," might she have said, "for a poor distressed creature; as good 
 for me to have staid at home, as come hither to be taunted at and 
 abused at this rate; not only to have a piteous case slighted, but to 
 be called a <I>dog!</I>" A proud, unhumbled heart would not have borne 
 it. The reputation of the house of Israel was not now so great in the 
 world, but that this slight put upon the Gentiles was capable of being 
 retorted, had the poor woman been so minded. It might have occasioned a 
 reflection upon Christ, and might have been a blemish upon his 
 reputation, as well as a shock to the good opinion, she had entertained 
 of him; for we re apt to judge of persons as we ourselves find them; 
 and think that they are what they are to us. "<I>Is this the Son of 
 David?</I>" (might she have said): "Is this he that has such a 
 reputation for kindness, tenderness, and compassion? I am sure I have 
 no reason to give him that character, for I was never treated so 
 roughly in my life; he might have done as much for me as for others; 
 or, if not, he needed not to have <I>set me with the dogs of his 
 flock.</I> I am not a dog, I am a woman, and an honest woman, and a 
 woman in misery; and I am sure it is not meet to call me a <I>dog.</I>" 
 No, here is not a word of this. Note, A humble, believing soul, that 
 truly loves Christ, takes every thing in good part that he saith and 
 doeth, and puts the best construction upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 She breaks through all these discouragements,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) With a holy earnestness of desire in prosecuting her petition. 
 This appeared upon the former repulse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 <I>Then came she, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</I> 

 [1.] She continued to pray. What Christ said, silenced the disciples;
 you hear no more of them; they took the answer, but the woman did not.
 Note, The more sensibly we feel the burthen, the more resolutely we 
 should pray for the removal of it. <I>And it is the will of God that we 
 should continue instant in prayer, should always pray, and not 
 faint.</I>

 [2.] She improved in prayer. Instead of blaming Christ, or charging him 
 with unkindness, she seems rather to suspect herself, and lay the fault 
 upon herself. She fears lest, in her first address, she had not been 
 humble and reverent enough, and therefore now <I>she came, and 
 worshipped him,</I> and paid him more respect than she had done; or she 
 fears that she had not been earnest enough, and therefore now she 
 cries, <I>Lord, help me.</I> Note, When the answers of prayer are 
 deferred, God is thereby teaching us to pray more, and pray better. It 
 is then time to enquire wherein we have come short in our former 
 prayers, that what has been amiss may be amended for the future.
 Disappointments in the success of prayer, must be excitements to the 
 duty of prayer. Christ, in his agony, <I>prayed more earnestly.</I>

 [3.] She waives the question, whether she was of those to whom Christ 
 was sent or no; she will not argue that with him, though perhaps she 
 might have claimed some kindred to the house of Israel; but, "Whether 
 an Israelite or no, I come to the Son of David for mercy, and <I>I will 
 not let him go, except he bless me.</I>" Many weak Christians perplex 
 themselves with questions and doubts about their election, whether they 
 are of the house of Israel or no; such had better mind their errand to 
 God, and continue instant in prayer for mercy and grace; throw 
 themselves by faith at the feet of Christ, and say, <I>If I perish, I 
 will perish here;</I> and then that matter will by degrees clear 
 itself. If we cannot <I>reason</I> down our unbelief, let us 
 <I>pray</I> it down. A fervent, affectionate <I>Lord, help me,</I> will 
 help us over many of the discouragements which are sometimes ready to 
 bear us down and overwhelm us. 

 [4.] Her prayer is very short, but comprehensive and fervent, <I>Lord, 
 help me.</I> Take this, <I>First,</I> As lamenting her case; "If the 
 Messiah be sent only to the house of Israel, the <I>Lord help me,</I> 
 what will become of me and mine," Note, It is not in vain for broken 
 hearts to bemoan themselves; God looks upon them then, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18">Jer. xxxi. 18</A>.

 Or, <I>Secondly,</I> As begging grace to insist her in this hour of
 temptation. She found it hard to keep up her faith when it was thus 
 frowned upon, and therefore prays, "<I>Lord, help me;</I> Lord, 
 strengthen my faith now; <I>Lord, let thy right hand uphold me,</I> 
 while my soul is <I>following hard after thee,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:8">Ps. lxiii. 8</A>.

 Or, <I>Thirdly,</I> As enforcing her original request, "<I>Lord, help
 me;</I> Lord, give me what I come for." She believed that Christ could 
 and would help her, though she was not of the house of Israel; else she 
 would have dropt her petition. Still she keeps up good thoughts of
 Christ, and will not quit her hold. <I>Lord, help me,</I> is a good
 prayer, if well put up; and it is pity that it should be turned into a 
 byword, and that we should take God's name in vain in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) With a holy skilfulness of faith, suggesting a very surprising 
 plea. Christ had placed the Jews with the children, <I>as olive-plants 
 round about</I> God's <I>table,</I> and had put the Gentiles with the 
 dogs, under the table; and she doth not deny the aptness of the 
 similitude. Note, There is nothing got by contradicting any word of 
 Christ, though it bear ever so hard upon us. But this poor woman, since 
 she cannot object against it, resolves to make the best of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);
 
 <I>Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs.</I> Now, here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Her acknowledgment was very humble: <I>Truth, Lord.</I> Note, You 
 cannot speak so meanly and slightly of a humble believer, but he is 
 ready to speak as meanly and slightly of himself. Some that seem to 
 dispraise and disparage themselves, will yet take it as an affront if 
 others do so too; but one that is humbled aright, will subscribe to the 
 most abasing challenges, and not call them abusing ones. "<I>Truth, 
 Lord;</I> I cannot deny it; I am a dog, and have no right to the 
 children's bread." David, <I>Thou hast done foolishly, very foolishly; 
 Truth, Lord.</I> Asaph, Thou <I>hast been as a beast before God; Truth, 
 Lord.</I> Agur, Thou art <I>more brutish than any man; Truth, Lord.</I> 
 Paul, Thou hast been <I>the chief of sinners, art less than the least 
 of saints, not meet to be called an apostle; Truth, Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Her improvement of this into a plea was very ingenious; <I>Yet the 
 dogs eat of the crumbs.</I> It was by a singular acumen, and spiritual 
 quickness and sagacity, that she discerned matter of argument in that 
 which looked like a slight. Note, A lively, active faith will make that 
 to be for us, which seems to be against us; will fetch <I>meat out of 
 the eater, and sweetness out of the strong.</I> Unbelief is apt to 
 mistake recruits for enemies, and to draw dismal conclusions even from 
 comfortable premises 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:22,23">Judges xiii. 22, 23</A>);

 but faith can find encouragement even in that which is discouraging, 
 and get nearer to God by taking hold on that hand which is stretched 
 out to push it away. So good a thing it is to be of <I>quick 
 understanding in the fear of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:3">Isa. xi. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Her plea is, <I>Yet the dogs eat of the crumbs.</I> It is true, the 
 full and regular provision is intended for the children only, but the 
 small, casual, neglected crumbs are allowed to the dogs, and are not 
 grudged them; that is to the dogs under the table, that attend there 
 expecting them. We poor Gentiles cannot expect the stated ministry and 
 miracles of the Son of David, that belongs to the Jews; but they begin 
 now to be weary of their meat, and to play with it, they find fault 
 with it, and crumble it away; surely then some of the broken meat may 
 fall to a poor Gentile; "I beg a cure by the by, which is but a crumb, 
 though of the same precious bread, yet but a small inconsiderable 
 piece, compared with the loaves which they have." Note, When we are 
 ready to surfeit on the children's bread, we should remember how many 
 there are, that would be glad of the crumbs. Our broken meat in 
 spiritual privileges, would be a feast to many a soul; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:42">Acts xiii. 42</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Her humility and necessity made her glad of crumbs. Those 
 who are conscious to themselves that they deserve nothing, will be 
 thankful for any thing; and <I>then</I> we are prepared for the 
 greatest of God's mercies, when we see ourselves less than the least of 
 them. The least of Christ is precious to a believer, and the very 
 crumbs of the bread of life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Her faith encouraged her to expect these crumbs. Why 
 should it not be at Christ's table as at a great man's, where the dogs 
 are fed as sure as the children? Observe, She calls it their 
 <I>master's</I> table; if she were a dog, she was <I>his</I> dog, and 
 it cannot be ill with us, if we stand but in the meanest relation to 
 Christ; "Though unworthy to be called children, yet <I>make me as one 
 of thy hired servants:</I> nay, rather let me be set with the dogs than 
 turned out of the house; for <I>in my Father's house there is not only 
 bread enough, but to spare,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:17-19">Luke xv. 17-19</A>.

 It is good lying in God's house, though we lie at the threshold
 there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The happy issue and success of all this. She came off with credit 
 and comfort from this struggle; and, though a Canaanite, approved 
 herself a true daughter of Israel, who, <I>like a prince, had power 
 with God, and prevailed.</I> Hitherto Christ hid his face from her, but 
 now <I>gathers her with everlasting kindness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 <I>Then Jesus said, O woman, great is thy faith.</I> This was like
 Joseph's making himself know to his brethren, <I>I am Joseph;</I> so 
 here, in effect, <I>I am Jesus.</I> Now he begins to speak like 
 himself, and to put on his own countenance. <I>He will not contend for 
 ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He commended her faith. <I>O woman, great is thy faith.</I> 
 Observe, 

 [1.] It is her faith that he commends. There were several other graces 
 that shone bright in her conduct of this affair-wisdom, humility, 
 meekness, patience, perseverance in prayer; but these were the product 
 of her faith, and therefore Christ fastens upon that as most 
 commendable; because of all graces faith honours Christ most, therefore 
 of all graces Christ honours faith most.

 [2.] It is the greatness of her faith. Note, <I>First,</I> Though the 
 faith of all the saints is alike precious, yet it is not in all alike 
 strong; all believers are not of the same size and stature. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> The greatness of faith consists much in a resolute 
 adherence to Jesus Christ as an all-sufficient Saviour, even in the 
 face of discouragements; to love him, and trust him, as a Friend, even 
 then when he seems to come forth against us as an Enemy. This is 
 <I>great faith! Thirdly,</I> Though weak faith, if true, shall not be 
 rejected, yet great faith shall be commended, and shall appear greatly 
 well-pleasing to Christ; for in them that thus believe he is most 
 admired. Thus Christ commended the faith of the centurion, and he was a 
 Gentile too, he had a strong faith in the power of Christ, this woman 
 in the good-will of Christ; both were acceptable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He cured her daughter; "<I>Be it unto thee even as thou wilt:</I> 
 I can deny thee nothing, take what thou camest for." Note, Great 
 believers may have what they will for the asking. When our will 
 conforms to the will of Christ's precept, his will concurs with the 
 will of our desire. Those that will deny Christ nothing, shall find 
 that he will deny them nothing at last, though for a time he seems to 
 hide his face from them. "Thou wouldst have thy sins pardoned, thy 
 corruptions mortified, thy nature sanctified; <I>be it unto thee even 
 as thou wilt.</I> And what canst thou desire more?" When we come, as 
 this poor woman did, to pray against Satan and his kingdom, we concur 
 with the intercession of Christ, and it shall be accordingly. Though 
 Satan may <I>sift</I> Peter, and <I>buffet</I> Paul, yet, through 
 Christ's prayer and the sufficiency of his grace, <I>we shall be more 
 than conquerors,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:31,32,2Co+12:7-9,Ro+16:20">Luke xxii. 31, 32;
 2 Cor. xii. 7-9; Rom. xvi. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The event was answerable to the word of Christ; <I>Her daughter was 
 made whole from that very hour;</I> from thenceforward was never vexed 
 with the devil any more; the mother's faith prevailed for the 
 daughter's cure. Though the patient was at a distance, that was no 
 hindrance to the efficacy of Christ's word. <I>He spake, and it was 
 done.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea
 of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
 &nbsp; 30  And great multitudes came unto him, having with them <I>those
 that were</I> lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast
 them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
 &nbsp; 31  Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb
 to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind
 to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 32  Then Jesus called his disciples <I>unto him,</I> and said, I have
 compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now
 three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them
 away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
 &nbsp; 33  And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so
 much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
 &nbsp; 34  And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they
 said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
 &nbsp; 35  And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
 &nbsp; 36  And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave
 thanks, and brake <I>them,</I> and gave to his disciples, and the
 disciples to the multitude.
 &nbsp; 37  And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of
 the broken <I>meat</I> that was left seven baskets full.
 &nbsp; 38  And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women
 and children.
 &nbsp; 39  And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into
 the coasts of Magdala.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A general account of Christ's cures, his curing by wholesale. The 
 tokens of Christ's power and goodness are neither scarce nor scanty; 
 for there is in him an overflowing fulness. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The place where these cures were wrought; it was <I>near the sea of 
 Galilee,</I> a part of the country Christ was much conversant with. We 
 read not of any thing he did in the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, but the 
 casting of the devil out of the woman of Canaan's daughter, as if he 
 took that journey on purpose, with that in prospect. Let not ministers 
 grudge their pains to do good, though but to few. He that knows the 
 worth of souls, would go a great way to help to save one from death and 
 Satan's power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But <I>Jesus departed thence.</I> Having let fall that crumb under 
 table, he here returns to make a full feast for the children. We may do 
 that occasionally for one, which we may not make a constant practice 
 of. Christ steps into the coast of Tyre and Sidon, but he <I>sits down 
 by the sea of Galilee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 sits down not on a stately throne, or tribunal of judgment, but on a 
 mountain: so mean and homely were his most solemn appearances in the 
 days of his flesh! He <I>sat down on a mountain,</I> that all might see 
 him, and have free access to him; for he is an open Saviour. He sat 
 down there, as one tired with his journey, and willing to have a little 
 rest; or rather, as one waiting to be gracious. He sat, expecting 
 patients, as Abraham at his tent-door, ready to entertain strangers. He 
 settled himself to this good work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The multitudes and maladies that were healed by him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);
 
 <I>Great multitudes came to him;</I> that the scripture might be 
 fulfilled, <I>Unto him shall the gathering of the people be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.

 If Christ's ministers could cure bodily diseases as Christ did, there
 would be more flocking to them than there is; we are soon sensible of 
 bodily pain and sickness, but few are concerned about their souls and 
 their spiritual diseases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 (1.) Such was the goodness of Christ, that he admitted all sorts of 
 people; the poor as well as the rich are welcome to Christ, and with 
 him there is room enough for all comers. He never complained of crowds 
 or throngs of seekers, or looked with contempt upon the vulgar, the 
 <I>herd,</I> as they are called; for the souls of peasants are as 
 precious with him as the souls of princes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Such was the power of Christ, that he healed all sorts of
 diseases; those that came to him, brought their sick relations and 
 friends along with them, and <I>cast them down at Jesus' feet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 We read not of any thing they said to him, but they laid them down
 before him as objects of pity, to be looked upon by him. Their 
 calamities spake more for them than the tongue of the most eloquent 
 orator could. <I>David showed before God his trouble,</I> that was 
 enough, he then left it with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+142:2">Ps. cxlii. 2</A>.

 Whatever our case is, the only way to find ease and relief, is, to lay
 it at Christ's feet, to spread it before him, and refer it to his 
 cognizance, and then submit it to him, and refer it to his disposal. 
 Those that would have spiritual healing from Christ, must lay 
 themselves at his feet, to be ruled and ordered as he pleaseth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here were <I>lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others,</I> brought to 
 Christ. See what work sin has made! It has turned the world into a 
 hospital: what various diseases are human bodies subject to! See what 
 work the Saviour makes! He conquers those hosts of enemies to mankind. 
 Here were such diseases as a flame of fancy could contribute neither to 
 the cause of nor to the cure of; as lying not in the humours, but in 
 the members of the body; and yet these were subject to the commands of 
 Christ. <I>He sent his word, and healed them.</I> Note, All diseases 
 are at the command of Christ, to go and come as he bids them. This is 
 an instance of Christ's power, which may comfort us in all our 
 weaknesses; and of his pity, which may comfort us in all our 
 miseries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The influence that this had upon the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They <I>wondered,</I> and well they might. Christ's works should 
 be our wonder. <I>It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:23">Ps. cxviii. 23</A>.

 The spiritual cures that Christ works are wonderful. When blind souls
 are made to see by faith, <I>the dumb to speak</I> in prayer, <I>the 
 lame to walk</I> in holy obedience, it is to be wondered at. <I>Sing
 unto the Lord a new song, for</I> thus <I>he has done marvellous 
 things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>They glorified the God of Israel,</I> whom the Pharisees, when 
 they saw these things, blasphemed. Miracles, which are the matter of 
 our wonder, must be the matter of our praise; and mercies, which are 
 the matter of our rejoicing, must be the matter of our thanksgiving. 
 Those that were healed, glorified God; if he heal our diseases, all 
 that is within us must bless his holy name; and if we have been 
 graciously preserved from blindness, and lameness, and dumbness, we 
 have as much reason to bless God as if we had been cured of them; nay, 
 and the standers-by glorified God. Note, God must be acknowledged with 
 praise and thankfulness in the mercies of others as in our own. <I>They 
 glorified</I> him as <I>the God of Israel,</I> his church's God, a God 
 in covenant with his people, who hath sent the Messiah promised; and 
 this is he. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:68">Luke i. 68</A>.

 <I>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel.</I> This was done by the power of
 the God of Israel, and no other could do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a particular account of his feeding <I>four thousand 
 men</I> with <I>seven loaves, and a few little fishes,</I> as he had 
 lately fed <I>five thousand with five loaves.</I> The guests indeed 
 were now not quite so many as then, and the provision a little more; 
 which does not intimate that Christ's arm was shortened, but that he 
 wrought his miracles as the occasion required, and not for ostentation, 
 and therefore he suited them to the occasion: both then and now he took 
 as many as were to be fed, and made use of all that was at hand to feed 
 them with. When once the utmost powers of nature are exceeded, we must 
 say, <I>This is the finger of God;</I> and it is neither here nor there 
 how far they are outdone; so that this is no less a miracle than the 
 former.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. Christ's pity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 <I>I have compassion on the multitude.</I> He tells his disciples this, 
 both to try and to excite their compassion. When he was about to work
 this miracle, he called them to him, and made them acquainted with his 
 purpose, and discoursed with them about it; not because he needed their 
 advice, but because he would give an instance of his condescending love 
 to them. He called them not <I>servants,</I> for <I>the servant knows 
 not what his Lord doeth,</I> but treated them as his friends and 
 counsellors. <I>Shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:17">Gen. xviii. 17</A>.
 
 In what he said to them, Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The case of the multitude; <I>They continue with me now three 
 days, and have nothing to eat.</I> This is an instance of their zeal, 
 and the strength of their affection to Christ and his word, that they 
 not only left their callings, to attend upon him on week-days, but 
 underwent a deal of hardship, to continue with him; they wanted their 
 natural rest, and, for aught that appeared, lay like soldiers in the 
 field; they wanted necessary food, and had scarcely enough to keep life 
 and soul together. In those hotter countries they could better bear 
 long fasting than we can in these colder climates: but though it could 
 not but be grievous to the body, and might endanger their health, yet 
 <I>the zeal of God's house thus ate them up,</I> and they esteemed the 
 words of Christ more than their necessary food. We think three hours 
 too much to attend upon public ordinances; but these people staid 
 together three days, and yet snuffed not at it, nor said, <I>Behold, 
 what a weariness is it!</I> Observe, With what tenderness Christ spoke 
 of it; <I>I have compassion on them.</I> It had become them to have 
 compassion on him, who took so much pains with them for three days 
 together, and was so indefatigable in teaching and healing; so much 
 virtue had gone out of him, and yet for aught that appears he was 
 fasting too: but he prevented them with his compassion. Note, Our Lord 
 Jesus keeps an account how long his followers continue their attendance 
 on him, and takes notice of the difficulty they sustain in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:2">Rev. ii. 2</A>);

 <I>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience:</I> and it shall 
 <I>in no wise lose its reward.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the exigence the people were reduced to serves to magnify. 

 [1.] The mercy of their supply: he fed them when they were hungry; and 
 then food was doubly welcome. He treated them as he did Israel of old; 
 <I>he suffered them to hunger, and then fed them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:3">Deut. viii. 3</A>);

 for that is <I>sweet to the hungry soul,</I> which <I>the full soul 
 loathes.</I> 

 [2.] The miracle of their supply: having been so long fasting, their 
 appetites were the more craving. If two hungry meals make the third a 
 glutton, what would three hungry days do? And yet <I>they did all eat 
 and were filled.</I> Note, There are mercy and grace enough with 
 Christ, to give the most earnest and enlarged desire an abundant 
 satisfaction; <I>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. He
 replenisheth even the hungry soul.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The care of our master concerning them; <I>I will not send them 
 away fasting, lest they should faint by the way;</I> which would be a 
 discredit to Christ and his family, and a discouragement both to them 
 and to others. Note, It is the unhappiness of our present state, that 
 when our souls are in some measure elevated and enlarged, our bodies 
 cannot keep pace with them in good duties. The weakness of the flesh is 
 a great grievance to the willingness of the spirit. It will not be so 
 in heaven, where the body shall be made spiritual, where <I>they rest 
 not, day and night, from praising God,</I> and yet faint not; where 
 <I>they hunger no more, nor thirst any more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:16">Rev. vii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 2. Christ's power. His pity of their wants sets his power on work for 
 their supply. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How his power was distrusted by his disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 <I>whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness?</I> A proper 
 question, one would think, like that of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:22">Num. xi. 22</A>).

 <I>Shall the flocks and the herds be slain to suffice them?</I> But it 
 was here an improper question, considering not only the general 
 assurance the disciples had of the power of Christ, but the particular 
 experience they lately had of a seasonable and sufficient provision by 
 miracle in a like case; they had been not only the witnesses, but the 
 ministers, of the former miracle; the multiplied bread went through 
 their hands; so that it was an instance of great weakness for them to 
 ask, <I>Whence shall we have bread?</I> Could they be at a loss, while 
 they had their Master with them? Note, Forgetting former experiences 
 leaves us under present doubts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ knew how slender the provision was, but he would know it from 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 <I>How many loaves have ye?</I> Before he would work, he would have it 
 seen how little he had to work on, that his power might shine the 
 brighter. What they had, they had for themselves, and it was little 
 enough for their own family; but Christ would have them bestow it all 
 upon the multitude, and trust Providence for more. Note, it becomes 
 Christ's disciples to be generous, their Master was so: what we have, 
 we should be free of, as there is occasion; <I>given to 
 hospitality;</I> not like Nabal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:11">1 Sam. xxv. 11</A>),
 
 but like Elisha, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:42">2 Kings iv. 42</A>.

 Niggardliness to-day, out of thoughtfulness for to-morrow, is a 
 complication of corrupt affection that ought to be mortified. If we be 
 prudently kind and charitable with what we have, we may piously hope 
 that God will send more. <I>Jehovah-jireh, The Lord will provide.</I> 
 The disciples asked, <I>Whence should we have bread?</I> Christ asked, 
 <I>How many loaves have ye?</I> Note, When we cannot have what we 
 would, we must make the best of what we have, and do good with it as 
 far as it will go; we must not think so much of our wants as of our 
 havings. Christ herein went according to the rule he gave to Martha, 
 not to be <I>troubled about many things, nor cumbered about much 
 serving.</I> Nature is content with little, grace with less, but lust 
 with nothing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How his power was discovered to the multitude, in the plentiful 
 provision he made for them; the manner of which is much the same as 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:18"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 18</A>,

 &c. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The provision that was at hand; <I>seven loaves, and a few 
 fishes:</I> the fish not proportionable to the bread, for bread is the 
 staff of life. It is probable that the fish was such as they had 
 themselves taken; for they were fishers, and were now near the sea. 
 Note, It is comfortable to <I>eat the labour of our hands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:2">Ps. cxxviii. 2</A>),

 and to enjoy that which is any way the product of our own industry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+12:27">Prov. xii. 27</A>.

 And what we have got by God's blessing on our labour we should be free 
 of; for <I>therefore</I> we must labour, <I>that we may have to 
 give,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:28">Eph. iv. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The putting of the people in a posture to receive it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);
 
 <I>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</I> They saw 
 but very little provision, yet they must sit down, in faith that they 
 should have a meal's meat out of it. They who would have spiritual food 
 from Christ, must sit down at his feet, to hear his word, and expect it 
 to come in an unseen way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The distributing of the provision among them. He first <I>gave 
 thanks</I>--<B><I>eucharistesas</I></B>. The word used in the former
 miracle was <B><I>eulogese</I></B>--<I>he blessed.</I> It comes all to
 one; giving thanks to God is a proper way of craving a blessing from 
 God. And when we come to ask and receive further mercy, we ought to 
 give thanks for the mercies we have received. He then <I>broke the 
 loaves</I> (for it was in the breaking that the bread multiplied) 
 <I>and gave to his disciples, and they to the multitude.</I> Though the 
 disciples had distrusted Christ's power, yet he made use of them now as 
 before; he is not provoked, as he might be, by the weakness and 
 infirmities of his ministers, to lay them aside; but still he gives to 
 them, and they to his people, of the word of life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] The plenty there was among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>).

 <I>They did all eat, and were filled.</I> Note, Those whom Christ 
 feeds, he fills. While we labour for the world, we labour for that 
 which satisfieth not 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:2">Isa. lv. 2</A>);

 but those that duly wait on Christ shall be <I>abundantly satisfied 
 with the goodness of his house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:4">Ps. lxv. 4</A>.

 Christ thus fed people once and again, to intimate that though he was
 called Jesus of Nazareth, yet he was <I>of Bethlehem, the house of 
 bread;</I> or rather, that he was himself <I>the Bread of Life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To show that they had all enough, there was a great deal left--<I>seven
 baskets full of broken meat;</I> not so much as there was before, 
 because they did not gather after so many eaters, but enough to show 
 that with Christ <I>there is bread enough, and to spare;</I> supplies 
 of grace for more than seek it, and for those that seek more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] The account taken of the guests; not that they might pay their 
 share (here was no reckoning to be discharged, they were fed gratis), 
 but that they might be witnesses to the power and goodness of Christ, 
 and that this might be some resemblance of that universal providence
 that <I>gives food to all flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:25">Ps. cxxxvi. 25</A>.

 Here were four thousand men fed; but what were they to that great
 family which is provided for by the divine care every day? God is a 
 great Housekeeper, on whom <I>the eyes of all the creatures wait, and 
 he giveth them their food in due season,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:27,145:15">Ps. civ. 27; cxlv. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [6.] The dismission of the multitude, and Christ's departure to another 
 place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>).

 He <I>sent away</I> the people. Though he had fed them twice, they must 
 not expect miracles to be their daily bread. Let them now go home to 
 their callings, and to their own tables. And he himself departed by 
 ship to another place; for, being the <I>Light of the world,</I> he 
 must be still <I>in motion, and go about to do good.</I></P>
