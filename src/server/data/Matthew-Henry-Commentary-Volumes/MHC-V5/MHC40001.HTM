 This evangelist begins with the account of Christ's parentage and
 birth, the ancestors from whom he descended, and the manner of his
 entry into the world, to make it appear that he was indeed the Messiah 
 promised, for it was foretold that he should be the son of David, and 
 should be born of a virgin; and that he was so is here plainly shown; 
 for here is, 

 I. His pedigree from Abraham in forty-two generations, three fourteens, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:1-17">ver. 1-17</A>.

 II. An account of the circumstances of his birth, so far as was 
 requisite to show that he was born of a virgin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:18-25">ver. 18-25</A>.

 Thus methodically is the life of our blessed Saviour written, as lives
 should be written, for the clearer proposing of the example of 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
 the son of Abraham.
 &nbsp; 2  Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
 Judas and his brethren;
 &nbsp; 3  And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat
 Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
 &nbsp; 4  And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and
 Naasson begat Salmon;
 &nbsp; 5  And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth;
 and Obed begat Jesse;
 &nbsp; 6  And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
 Solomon of her <I>that had been the wife</I> of Urias;
 &nbsp; 7  And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia
 begat Asa;
 &nbsp; 8  And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram
 begat Ozias;
 &nbsp; 9  And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz
 begat Ezekias;
 &nbsp; 10  And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and
 Amon begat Josias;
 &nbsp; 11  And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time
 they were carried away to Babylon:
 &nbsp; 12  And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat
 Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
 &nbsp; 13  And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and
 Eliakim begat Azor;
 &nbsp; 14  And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat
 Eliud;
 &nbsp; 15  And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and
 Matthan begat Jacob;
 &nbsp; 16  And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
 Jesus, who is called Christ.
 &nbsp; 17  So all the generations from Abraham to David <I>are</I> fourteen
 generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon
 <I>are</I> fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into
 Babylon unto Christ <I>are</I> fourteen generations.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Concerning this genealogy of our Saviour, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The title of it. It is <I>the book</I> (or the account, as the 
 Hebrew word <I>sepher, a book,</I> sometimes signifies) <I>of the 
 generation of Jesus Christ,</I> of his ancestors according to the 
 flesh; or, It is the narrative of his birth. It is <B><I>Biblos 
 Geneseos</I></B>--<I>a book of Genesis.</I> The Old Testament begins
 with the book of the generation of the world, and it is its glory that 
 it does so; but the glory of the New Testament <I>herein</I> excelleth, 
 that it begins with <I>the book of the generation of</I> him that made 
 the world. As God, <I>his outgoings were of old, from everlasting</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:2">Mic. v. 2</A>),

 and none can declare that generation; but, as man, he was <I>sent forth
 in the fulness of time, born of a woman,</I> and it is that generation 
 which is here declared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The principal intention of it. It is not an endless or needless 
 genealogy; it is not a vain-glorious one, as those of great men 
 commonly are. <I>Stemmata, quid faciunt?--Of what avail are ancient
 pedigrees?</I> It is like a pedigree given in evidence, to prove a 
 title, and make out a claim; the design is to prove that our Lord Jesus 
 is <I>the son of David,</I> and <I>the son of Abraham,</I> and 
 therefore of that nation and family out of which the Messiah was to 
 arise. Abraham and David were, in their day, the great trustees of the 
 promise relating to the Messiah. <I>The promise</I> of the <I>blessing 
 was made to Abraham and his seed,</I> of the <I>dominion to David and 
 his seed;</I> and they who would have an interest in Christ, as <I>the 
 son of Abraham, in whom all the families of the earth are to be 
 blessed,</I> must be faithful, loyal subjects to him as <I>the son of 
 David,</I> by whom <I>all the families of the earth</I> are to be 
 ruled. It was promised to Abraham that Christ should descend from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3,22:18">Gen. xii. 3; xxii. 18</A>),
 
 and to David that he should descend from him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:12,Ps+89:3,132:11">2 Sam. vii. 12; 
 Ps. lxxxix. 3, &c.; cxxxii. 11</A>);

 and therefore, unless it can be proved that Jesus is a <I>son of
 David,</I> and a <I>son of Abraham,</I> we cannot admit him to be the 
 Messiah. Now this is here proved from the authentic records of the
 heralds' offices. The Jews were very exact in preserving their 
 pedigrees, and there was a providence in it, for the clearing up of the 
 descent of the Messiah from the fathers; and since his coming that 
 nation is so dispersed and confounded that it is a question whether any 
 person in the world can legally prove himself to be <I>a son of 
 Abraham;</I> however, it is certain that none can prove himself to 
 either a son of Aaron or a <I>son of David,</I> so that the priestly 
 and kingly office must either be given up, as lost for ever, or be 
 lodged in the hands of our Lord Jesus. Christ is here first called 
 <I>the son of David,</I> because under that title he was commonly 
 spoken of, and expected, among the Jews. They who owned him to be 
 <I>the Christ,</I> called him <I>the son of David,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:22,20:31,21:15"><I>ch.</I> xv. 22; xx. 31; xxi. 15</A>.

 Thus, therefore, the evangelist undertakes to make out, that he is not
 only a <I>son of David,</I> but that <I>son of David</I> on whose 
 <I>shoulders the government was to be;</I> not only <I>a son of 
 Abraham,</I> but that <I>son of Abraham</I> who was to be <I>the father 
 of many nations.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In calling Christ the <I>son of David,</I> and <I>the son of 
 Abraham,</I> he shows that God is faithful to his promise, and will 
 make good every word that he has spoken; and this. 

 1. Though the performance be long deferred. When God promised Abraham a
 son, who should be the great blessing of the world, perhaps he expected 
 it should be his immediate son; but it proved to be one at the distance 
 of forty-two generations, and about 2000 years: so long before can God 
 foretel what shall be done, and so long after, sometimes, does God 
 fulfil what has been promised. Note, Delays of promised mercies, though 
 they exercise our patience, do not weaken God's promise. 

 2. Though it begin to be despaired of. This <I>son of David,</I> and
 <I>son of Abraham,</I> who was to be the glory of his Father's house, 
 was born when the seed of Abraham was a despised people, recently 
 become tributary to the Roman yoke, and when the house of David was 
 buried in obscurity; for Christ was to be <I>a root out of a dry 
 ground.</I> Note, God's time for the performance of his promises is 
 when it labours under the greatest improbabilities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The particular series of it, drawn in the direct line from Abraham 
 downward, according to the genealogies recorded in the beginning of the 
 books of Chronicles (as far as those go), and which here we see the use 
 of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some particulars we may observe in the genealogy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Among the ancestors of Christ who had brethren, generally he 
 descended from a younger brother; such Abraham himself was, and Jacob, 
 and Judah, and David, and Nathan, and Rhesa; to show that the 
 pre-eminence of Christ came not, as that of earthly princes, from the 
 primogeniture of his ancestors, but from the will of God, who, 
 according to the method of his providence, <I>exalteth them of low 
 degree,</I> and puts <I>more abundant honour upon that part which 
 lacked.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Among the sons of Jacob, besides Judah, from whom Shiloh came, 
 notice is here taken of <I>his brethren: Judas and his brethren.</I> No 
 mention is made of Ishmael the son of Abraham, or of Esau the son of 
 Isaac, because they were shut out of the church; whereas all the 
 children of Jacob were taken in, and, though not fathers of Christ, 
 were yet patriarchs of the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:8">Acts vii. 8</A>),

 and therefore are mentioned in the genealogy, for the encouragement of
 the <I>twelve tribes that were scattered abroad,</I> intimating to them 
 that they have an interest in Christ, and stand in relation to him as 
 well as Judah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Phares and Zara, the twin-sons of Judah, are likewise both named, 
 though Phares only was Christ's ancestor, for the same reason that the 
 brethren of Judah are taken notice of; and some think because the birth 
 of Phares and Zara had something of an allegory in it. Zara put out his 
 hand first, as the first-born, but, drawing it in, Phares got the 
 birth-right. The Jewish church, like Zara, reached first at the 
 birthright, but through unbelief, withdrawing the hand, the Gentile 
 church, like Phares, broke forth and went away with the birthright; and 
 thus <I>blindness is in part happened unto Israel, till the fulness of 
 the Gentiles become in,</I> and then Zara shall be born--<I>all Israel
 shall be saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:25,26">Rom. xi. 25, 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. There are four women, and but four, named in this genealogy; two of 
 them were originally <I>strangers to the commonwealth of Israel,</I> 
 Rachab a Canaanitess, and a harlot besides, and Ruth the Moabitess; for 
 <I>in Jesus Christ there is neither Greek, nor Jew;</I> those that are 
 <I>strangers and foreigners</I> are welcome, in Christ, to <I>the 
 citizenship of the saints.</I> The other two were adulteresses, Tamar 
 and Bathsheba; which was a further mark of humiliation put upon our 
 Lord Jesus, that not only he descended from such, but that is decent 
 from them is particularly remarked in his genealogy, and no veil drawn 
 over it. He took upon him <I>the likeness of sinful flesh</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>),

 and takes even great sinners, upon their repentance, into the nearest
 relation to himself. Note, We ought not to upbraid people with the 
 scandals of their ancestors; it is what they cannot help, and has been 
 the lot of the best, even of our Master himself. <I>David's begetting
 Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias</I> is taken notice of 
 (says Dr. Whitby) to show that the crime of David, being repented to, 
 was so far from hindering the promise made to him, that it pleased God 
 by this very woman to fulfil it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Though divers kings are here named, yet none is expressly called a 
 king but David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>David the king;</I> because with him the covenant of royalty was
 made, and to him the promise of the kingdom of the Messiah was given,
 who is therefore said to inherit <I>the throne of his father David,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32">Luke i. 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. In the pedigree of the kings of Judah, between Joram and Ozias 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 there are three left out, namely, Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah; and
 therefore when it is said, <I>Joram begat Ozias,</I> it is meant, 
 according to the usage of the Hebrew tongue, that Ozias was lineally 
 descended from him, as it is said to Hezekiah that <I>the sons which he 
 should beget should be carried to Babylon,</I> whereas they were 
 removed several generations from him. It was not through mistake or 
 forgetfulness that these three were omitted, but, probably, they were 
 omitted in the genealogical tables that the evangelist consulted, which 
 yet were admitted as authentic. Some give this reason for it:--It being 
 Matthew's design, for the sake of memory, to reduce the number of 
 Christ's ancestors to three fourteens, it was requisite that in this 
 period three should be left out, and none more fit than they who were 
 the immediate progeny of cursed Athaliah, who introduced the idolatry 
 of Ahab into the house of David, for which this brand is set upon the 
 family and the iniquity thus visited <I>to the third and fourth 
 generation.</I> Two of these three were apostates; and such God 
 commonly sets a mark of his displeasure upon in this world: they all 
 three had their heads brought to the grave with blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Some observe what a mixture there was of good and bad in the 
 succession of these kings; as for instance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>),

 wicked <I>Roboam begat</I> wicked <I>Abia;</I> wicked <I>Abia begat</I>
 good <I>Asa;</I> good <I>Asa begat</I> good <I>Josaphat;</I> good 
 <I>Josaphat begat</I> wicked <I>Joram.</I> Grace does not run in the 
 blood, neither does reigning sin. God's grace is his own, and he gives 
 or withholds it as he pleases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. The captivity of Babylon is mentioned as a remarkable period in this 
 line, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 All things considered, it was a wonder that the Jews were not lost in
 that captivity, as other nations have been; but this intimates the 
 reason why the streams of that people were kept to run pure through 
 that dead sea, because from them, as <I>concerning the flesh, 
 Christ</I> was to <I>come. Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it,</I> 
 even that blessing of blessings, Christ himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8,9">Isa. lxv. 8, 9</A>.

 It was with an eye to him that they were restored, and the desolations
 of the sanctuary were looked upon with favour <I>for the Lord's 
 sake,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:17">Dan. ix. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. <I>Josias</I> is said to <I>beget Jechonias and his brethren</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 by Jechonias here is meant Jehoiakim, who was the first-born of Josias;
 but, when it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 that <I>Jechonias begat Salathiel,</I> that Jechonias was the son of
 that Jehoiakim who was carried into Babylon, and there begat 
 <I>Salathiel</I> (as Dr. Whitby shows), and, when Jechonias is said to 
 have been written <I>childless</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:30">Jer. xxii. 30</A>),

 it is explained thus: <I>No man of his seed shall prosper.
 Salathiel</I> is here said to <I>beget Zorobabel,</I> whereas Salathiel 
 begat Pedaiah, and he begat Zorobabel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:19">1 Chron. iii. 19</A>):

 but, as before, the grandson is often called the son; Pedaiah, it is
 likely, died in his father's lifetime, and so his son Zorobabel was 
 called the <I>son of Salathiel.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 10. The line is brought down, not to Mary the mother of our Lord, but 
 to <I>Joseph the husband of Mary</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 for the Jews always reckoned their genealogies by the males: yet Mary
 was of the same tribe and family with Joseph, so that, both by his 
 mother and by his supposed father, he was of the house of David; yet 
 his interest in that dignity is derived by Joseph, to whom really 
 according to the flesh he had no relation, to show that the kingdom of 
 the Messiah is not founded in a natural descent from David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 11. The centre in whom all these lines meet is <I>Jesus, who is called 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This is he that was so importunately desired, so impatiently expected,
 and to whom the patriarchs had an eye when they were so desirous of 
 children, that they might have the honour of coming into the sacred 
 line. Blessed be God, we are not now in such a dark and cloudy state of 
 expectation as they were then in, but see clearly what these prophets 
 and kings saw as through a glass darkly. And we may have, if it be not 
 our own fault, a greater honour than that of which they were so 
 ambitious: for they who do the will of God are in a more honourable 
 relation to Christ than those who were akin to him according to the 
 flesh,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:50"><I>ch.</I> xii. 50</A>.

 <I>Jesus</I> is called <I>Christ,</I> that is, the <I>Anointed,</I> the
 same with the <I>Hebrew</I> name <I>Messiah.</I> He is called
 <I>Messiah the Prince</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25">Dan. ix. 25</A>),
 
 and often God's <I>Anointed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:2">Ps. ii. 2</A>).

 Under this character he was expected: <I>Art thou the Christ</I>--the
 <I>anointed one?</I> David, the king, was anointed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:13">1 Sam. xvi. 13</A>);

 so was Aaron, the priest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:12">Lev. viii. 12</A>),

 and Elisha, the prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:16">1 Kings xix. 16</A>),

 and Isaiah, the prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>).

 Christ, being appointed to, and qualified for, all these offices, is 
 therefore called the <I>Anointed--anointed with the oil of gladness
 above his fellows;</I> and from this name of his, which is as ointment 
 poured forth, all his followers are called <I>Christians,</I> for they 
 also have <I>received the anointing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Lastly. The general summary of all this genealogy we have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,

 where it is summed up in three fourteens, signalized by remarkable
 periods.  In the first fourteen, we have the family of David rising, 
 and looking forth as the morning; in the second, we have it flourishing 
 in its meridian lustre; in the third, we have it declining and growing 
 less and less, dwindling into the family of a poor carpenter, and then 
 Christ <I>shines forth</I> out of it, the <I>glory of his people 
 Israel.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
 mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
 she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 19  Then Joseph her husband, being a just <I>man,</I> and not willing
 to make her a public example, was minded to put her away
 privily.
 &nbsp; 20  But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of
 the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son
 of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
 which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 21  And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his
 name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
 &nbsp; 22  Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
 spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
 &nbsp; 23  Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth
 a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
 interpreted is, God with us.
 &nbsp; 24  Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
 Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:
 &nbsp; 25  And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn
 son: and he called his name JESUS.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The mystery of Christ's incarnation is to be adored, not pried into. If 
 we <I>know not the way of the Spirit</I> in the formation of common 
 persons, nor <I>how the bones are formed in the womb of</I> any one 
 <I>that is with child</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:5">Eccles. xi. 5</A>),

 much less do we know how the blessed Jesus was formed in the womb of
 the blessed virgin. When David admires how he himself was <I>made in 
 secret,</I> and <I>curiously wrought</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:13-16">Ps. cxxxix. 13-16</A>),

 perhaps he speaks in the spirit of Christ's incarnation. Some
 circumstances attending the birth of Christ we find here which are not 
 in Luke, though it is more largely recorded here. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Mary's espousal to Joseph. Mary, the mother of our Lord, <I>was 
 espoused to Joseph,</I> not completely married, but contracted; a 
 purpose of marriage solemnly declared in words <I>de futuro--that
 regarding the future,</I> and a promise of it made if God permit. We 
 read of a man who <I>has betrothed a wife and has not taken her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:7">Deut. xx. 7</A>.
 
 Christ was born of a virgin, but a betrothed virgin,

 1. To put respect upon the marriage state, and to recommend it <I>as
 honourable among all,</I> against that doctrine of devils which 
 <I>forbids to marry,</I> and places perfection in the single state. Who 
 more highly favoured than Mary was in her espousals? 

 2. To save the credit of the blessed virgin, which otherwise would have
 been exposed. It was fit that her conception should be protected by a
 marriage, and so justified in the eye of the world. One of the ancients 
 says, It was better it should be asked, Is not this the <I>son of a 
 carpenter?</I> than, Is not this the <I>son of a harlot?</I> 

 3. That the blessed virgin might have one to be the guide of her youth,
 the companion of her solitude and travels, a partner in her cares, and 
 a help meet for her. Some think that Joseph was now a widower, and that 
 those who are called the <I>brethren of Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:55"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 55</A>),

 were Joseph's children by a former wife. This is the conjecture of many
 of the ancients. Joseph was a <I>just man,</I> she a <I>virtuous
 woman.</I> Those who are <I>believers</I> should not be <I>unequally 
 yoked with unbelievers:</I> but let those who are religious choose to 
 marry with those who are so, as they expect the comfort of the 
 relation, and God's blessing upon them in it. We may also learn, from 
 this example, that it is good to enter into the married state with 
 deliberation, and not hastily--to preface the nuptials with a contract.
 It is better to <I>take</I> time to consider before than to <I>find</I> 
 time to repent after.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Her pregnancy of the promised seed; <I>before they came 
 together,</I> she <I>was found with child,</I> which really was <I>of 
 the Holy Ghost.</I> The marriage was deferred so long after the 
 contract that she appeared to be <I>with child</I> before the time came 
 for the solemnizing of the marriage, though she was contracted before 
 she conceived. Probably, it was after her return from her cousin 
 Elizabeth, with whom she continued <I>three months</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:56">Luke i. 56</A>),

 that she was perceived by Joseph to be with child, and did not herself
 deny it. Note, Those in whom Christ is formed will show it: it will be 
 <I>found to be</I> a work of God which he will own. Now we may well 
 imagine, what a perplexity this might justly occasion to the blessed 
 virgin. She herself knew the divine original of this conception; but 
 how could she prove it? She would be <I>dealt with as a harlot.</I> 
 Note, After great and high advancements, lest we should be puffed up 
 with them, we must expect something or other to humble us, some 
 reproach, <I>as a thorn in the flesh,</I> nay, as <I>a sword in the 
 bones.</I> Never was any daughter of Eve so dignified as the Virgin 
 Mary was, and yet in danger of falling under the imputation of one of 
 the worse crimes; yet we do not find that she tormented herself about 
 it; but, being conscious of her own innocence, she kept her mind calm 
 and easy, and committed her cause to <I>him that judgeth 
 righteously.</I> Note, those who take care to keep a good conscience 
 may cheerfully trust God with the keeping of their good names, and have 
 reason to hope that he will clear up, not only their integrity, but 
 their honour, as the sun at noon day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Joseph's perplexity, and his care what to do in this case. We may 
 well imagine what a great trouble and disappointment it was to him to 
 find one he had such an opinion of, and value for, come under the 
 suspicion of such a heinous crime. <I>Is this Mary?</I> He began to 
 think, "How may we be deceived in those we think best of! How may we be 
 disappointed in what we expect most from!" He is loth to believe so ill 
 a thing of one whom he believed to be so good a woman; and yet the 
 matter, as it is too bad to be excused, is also too plain to be denied. 
 What a struggle does this occasion in his breast between that jealousy 
 which is the rage of man, and is cruel as the grave, on the one hand, 
 and that affection which he has for Mary on the other!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. The extremity which he studied to avoid. He was <I>not willing to
 make her a public example.</I> He might have done so; for, by the law, 
 a <I>betrothed virgin,</I> if she played the harlot, was to be stoned 
 to death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:23,24">Deut. xxii. 23, 24</A>.

 But he <I>was not willing</I> to take the advantage of the law against
 her; if she be guilty, yet it is not known, nor shall it be known from 
 him. How different was the spirit which Joseph displayed from that of 
 Judah, who in a similar case hastily passed that severe sentence, 
 <I>Bring her forth and let her be burnt!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:24">Gen. xxxviii. 24</A>.

 How good it is to <I>think on things,</I> as Joseph did here! Were
 there more of deliberation in our censures and judgments, there would 
 be more of mercy and moderation in them. Bringing her to punishment is
 here called <I>making her a public example;</I> which shows what is the 
 end to be aimed at in punishment--the giving of warning to others: it 
 is <I>in terrorem--that all about may hear and fear. Smite the 
 scorner,</I> and the simple will beware.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some persons of a rigorous temper would blame Joseph for his clemency: 
 but it is here spoken of to his praise; because <I>he was a just 
 man,</I> therefore he was not willing to expose her. He was a 
 <I>religious, good man;</I> and therefore inclined to be merciful as 
 God is, and to <I>forgive</I> as one that was <I>forgiven.</I> In the 
 case of the betrothed damsel, if she were defiled in the field, the law 
 charitably supposed that she <I>cried out</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:26">Deut. xxii. 26</A>),

 and she was not to be punished. Some charitable construction or other
 Joseph will put upon this matter; and herein he is a <I>just man,</I> 
 tender of the good name of one who never before had done anything to 
 blemish it. Note, It becomes us, in many cases, to be gentle towards
 those that come under suspicion of having offended, to hope the best 
 concerning them, and make the best of that which at first appears bad, 
 in hopes that it may prove better. <I>Summum just summa injuria--The 
 rigour of the law is</I> (sometimes) <I>the height of injustice.</I> 
 That court of conscience which moderates the rigour of the law we call 
 a <I>court of equity.</I> Those who are found faulty were perhaps 
 <I>overtaken in the fault,</I> and are therefore to be <I>restored with 
 the spirit of meekness;</I> and threatening, even when just, must be 
 moderated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The expedient he found out for avoiding this extremity. He was 
 <I>minded to put her away privily,</I> that is, to give a bill of 
 divorce into her hand before two witnesses, and so to hush up the 
 matter among themselves. Being a <I>just man,</I> that is, a strict 
 observer of the law, he would not proceed to marry her, but resolved to 
 <I>put her away;</I> and yet, in tenderness for her, determined to do 
 it as privately as possible. Note, The necessary censures of those who 
 have offended ought to be managed without noise. The <I>words of the 
 wise are heard in quiet.</I> Christ himself <I>shall not strive nor 
 cry.</I> Christian love and Christian prudence will <I>hide a multitude 
 of sins,</I> and great ones, as far as may be done without having 
 fellowship with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Joseph's discharge from this perplexity by an express sent from 
 heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 <I>While he thought on these things</I> and knew not what to determine,
 God graciously directed him what to do, and made him easy. Note, Those 
 who would have direction from God must <I>think on things</I> 
 themselves, and consult with themselves. It is the <I>thoughtful,</I> 
 not the <I>unthinking,</I> whom God will guide. When he was at a loss, 
 and had carried the matter as far as he could in his own thoughts, then 
 God came in with advice. Note, God's time to come in with instruction 
 to his people is when they are <I>nonplussed</I> and at a stand. God's 
 comforts most delight the soul <I>in the multitude</I> of its perplexed 
 <I>thoughts.</I> The message was sent to Joseph by an <I>angel of the 
 Lord,</I> probably the same angel that brought Mary the tidings of the 
 conception--the angel Gabriel. Now the intercourse with heaven, by 
 angels, with which the patriarchs had been dignified, but which had 
 been long disused, begins to be revived; for, when the 
 <I>First-begotten</I> is to be <I>brought into the world,</I> the 
 angels are ordered to attend his motions. How far God may now, in an 
 invisible way, make use of the ministration of angels, for extricating 
 his people out of their straits, we cannot say; but this we are sure 
 of, they are all <I>ministering spirits</I> for their good. This angel
 appeared to Joseph <I>in a dream</I> when he was asleep, as God 
 sometimes spoke unto the fathers. When we are most quiet and composed 
 we are in the best frame to receive the notices of the divine will. The 
 Spirit moves on the calm waters. This dream, no doubt, carried its own 
 evidence along with it that it was of God, and not the production of a 
 vain fancy. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Joseph is here <I>directed</I> to proceed in his intended marriage. 
 The angel calls him, <I>Joseph, thou son of David;</I> he puts him in 
 mind of his relation to David, that he might be prepared to receive 
 this surprising intelligence of his relation to the Messiah, who, every 
 one knew, was to be a descendant from David. Sometimes, when great 
 honours devolve upon those who have small estates, they care not for 
 accepting them, but are willing to drop them; it was therefore 
 requisite to put this poor carpenter in mind of his high birth: "Value 
 thyself. Joseph, thou art that <I>son of David</I> through whom the 
 line of the Messiah is to be drawn." We may thus say to every true 
 believer, "Fear not, thou son of Abraham, thou child of God; forget not 
 the dignity of thy birth, thy new birth." <I>Fear not to take Mary for 
 thy wife;</I> so it may be read. Joseph, suspecting she was with child 
 by whoredom, was afraid of <I>taking her,</I> lest he should bring upon 
 himself either guilt or reproach. No, saith God, <I>Fear not;</I> the 
 matter is not so. Perhaps Mary had told him that she was with child by 
 the Holy Ghost, and he might have heard what Elizabeth said to her 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:43">Luke i. 43</A>),

 when she called her the <I>mother of her Lord;</I> and, if so, he was
 afraid of presumption in marrying one so much above him. But, from 
 whatever cause his fears arose, they were all silenced with this word, 
 <I>Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife.</I> Note, It is a great 
 mercy to be delivered from our fears, and to have our doubts resolved, 
 so as to proceed in our affairs with satisfaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is here <I>informed</I> concerning that <I>holy thing</I> with 
 which his espoused wife was now pregnant. That which is conceived in 
 her is of a divine original. He is so far from being in danger of 
 sharing in an impurity by marrying her, that he will thereby share in 
 the highest dignity he is capable of. Two things he is told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That she had conceived <I>by the power of the Holy Ghost;</I> not 
 by the power of nature. The Holy Spirit, who produced the world, now 
 produced the Saviour of the world, and <I>prepared him a body,</I> as
 was promised him, when he said, <I>Lo, I come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:5">Heb. x. 5</A>.

 Hence he is said to be <I>made of a woman</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:4">Gal. iv. 4</A>),

 and yet to be that second <I>Adam</I> that is the <I>Lord from
 heaven,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:47">1 Cor. xv. 47</A>.

 He is the <I>Son of God,</I> and yet so far partakes of the substance
 of his mother as to be called the <I>fruit of her womb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:42">Luke i. 42</A>.

 It was requisite that is conception should be otherwise than by
 ordinary <I>generation,</I> that so, so though he partook of the human 
 nature, yet he might escape the corruption and pollution of it, and not 
 be <I>conceived</I> and <I>shapen</I> in iniquity. Histories tell us of 
 some who vainly pretended to have conceived by a divine power, as the 
 mother of Alexander; but none ever really did so, except the mother of 
 our Lord. His name in this, as in other things, is <I>Wonderful.</I> We 
 do not read that the virgin Mary did herself proclaim the honour done 
 to her; but she hid it in her heart, and therefore God sent an angel to 
 attest it. Those who seek not their own glory shall have the honour 
 that comes from God; it is reserved for the humble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That she should bring forth <I>the Saviour of the world</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>).

 <I>She shall bring forth a Son;</I> what he shall be is intimated,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] In the name that should be given to her Son: <I>Thou shalt call 
 his name Jesus, a Saviour.</I> Jesus is the same name with Joshua, the 
 termination only being changed, for the sake of conforming it to the 
 Greek. Joshua is called <I>Jesus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:45,Heb+4:8">Acts vii. 45; Heb. iv. 8</A>),

 from the Seventy. There were two of that name under the Old Testament,
 who were both illustrious types of Christ, Joshua who was Israel's
 captain at their first settlement in Canaan, and Joshua who was their
 high priest at their second settlement after the captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:11,12">Zech. vi. 11, 12</A>.

 Christ is our Joshua; both the <I>Captain of our salvation,</I> and the
 <I>High Priest of our profession,</I> and, in both, our Saviour--a
 Joshua who comes in the stead of Moses, and does that for us which the 
 <I>law could not do, in that it was weak.</I> Joshua had been called 
 <I>Hosea,</I> but Moses prefixed the first syllable of the name 
 <I>Jehovah,</I> and so made it <I>Jehoshua</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:16">Num. xiii. 16</A>),

 to intimate that the Messiah, who was to bear that name, should be
 <I>Jehovah;</I> he is therefore <I>able to save to the uttermost,</I> 
 neither is there <I>salvation in any other.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] In the reason of that name: <I>For he shall save his people from 
 their sins;</I> not the nation of the Jews only (he came to <I>his 
 own,</I> and they <I>received him not</I>), but all who were given him 
 by <I>the Father's choice,</I> and all who had given themselves to him 
 by <I>their own.</I> He is a king who <I>protects</I> his subjects, 
 and, as the judges of Israel of old, <I>works salvation</I> for them. 
 Note, those whom Christ saves he saves <I>from their sins;</I> from the 
 guilt of sin by the <I>merit of his death,</I> from the dominion of sin 
 by the <I>Spirit of his grace.</I> In saving them from sin, he saves 
 them from wrath and the curse, and all misery here and hereafter. 
 Christ came to save his people, not <I>in their sins,</I> but 
 <I>from</I> their sins; to purchase for them, not a liberty <I>to 
 sin,</I> but a liberty <I>from sins, to redeem them from all 
 iniquity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:14">Tit. ii. 14</A>);
 
 and so to redeem them <I>from among men</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:4">Rev. xiv. 4</A>)

 to himself, who is <I>separate from sinners.</I> So that those who
 leave their sins, and give up themselves to Christ as <I>his
 people,</I> are interested in the Saviour, and the great salvation
 which he has <I>wrought out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26">Rom. xi. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The fulfilling of the scripture in all this. This evangelist, 
 writing among the Jews, more frequently observes this than any other of 
 the evangelists. Here the Old Testament prophecies had their 
 accomplishment in our Lord Jesus, by which it appears that this was he 
 that should come, and we are to look for no other; for this was he 
 <I>to whom all the prophets bore witness.</I> Now the scripture that 
 was fulfilled in the birth of Christ was that promise of a sign which 
 God gave to king Ahaz 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:14">Isa. vii. 14</A>),

 <I>Behold a virgin shall conceive;</I> where the prophet, encouraging
 the people of God to hope for the promised deliverance from 
 Sennacherib's invasion, directs them to look forward to the Messiah, 
 who was to come of the people of the Jews, and the house of David; 
 whence it was easy to infer, that though that people and that house 
 were afflicted, yet neither the one nor the other could be abandoned to 
 ruin, so long as God had such an honour, such a blessing, in reserve 
 for them. The deliverances which God wrought for the Old-Testament 
 church were types and figures of the great salvation by Christ; and, if 
 God will do the greater, he will not fail to do the less.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophecy here quoted is justly ushered in with a <I>Behold,</I> 
 which commands both attention and admiration; for we have here the 
 mystery of godliness, which is, without controversy, great, that God 
 <I>was manifested in the flesh.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sign given is that the Messiah shall be <I>born of a virgin. A 
 virgin shall conceive,</I> and, by her, he shall be manifested <I>in 
 the flesh.</I> The word <I>Almah</I> signifies a <I>virgin</I> in the 
 strictest sense, such as Mary professes herself to be 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:34">Luke i. 34</A>),

 <I>I know not a man;</I> nor had it been any such wonderful sign as it
 was intended for, if it had been otherwise. It was intimated from the 
 beginning that the Messiah should be born of a virgin, when it was said 
 that he should be the <I>seed of the woman;</I> so the seed of the 
 woman as not to be the seed of any man. Christ was born of a virgin not 
 only because his birth was to be <I>supernatural,</I> and altogether 
 extraordinary, but because it was to be <I>spotless,</I> and pure, and 
 without any stain of sin. Christ would be born, not of an 
 <I>empress</I> or <I>queen,</I> for he appeared not in outward pomp or 
 splendour, but of a virgin, to teach us spiritual purity, to die to all 
 the delights of sense, and so to <I>keep ourselves unspotted</I> from 
 the world and the flesh that we may be presented <I>chaste virgins to 
 Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The truth proved by this sign is, that he is the Son of God, and the 
 Mediator between God and man: for <I>they shall call his name 
 Immanuel;</I> that is, he shall be <I>Immanuel;</I> and when it is 
 said, <I>He shall be called,</I> it is meant, he shall <I>be, the Lord 
 our righteousness. Immanuel</I> signifies <I>God with us;</I> a 
 mysterious name, but very precious; God <I>incarnate</I> among us, and 
 so God <I>reconcilable</I> to us, at peace with us, and taking us into 
 covenant and communion with himself. The people of the Jews had <I>God 
 with them,</I> in types and shadows, dwelling between the cherubim; but 
 never so as when the <I>Word was made flesh</I>--that was the blessed
 <I>Shechinah.</I> What a happy step is hereby taken toward the settling 
 of a peace and correspondence between God and man, that the two natures 
 are thus brought together in the person of the Mediator! by this he 
 became an unexceptionable referee, a days-man, fit to <I>lay his hand 
 upon them both,</I> since he partakes of the nature of both. Behold, in 
 this, the deepest mystery, and the richest mercy, that ever was. By the 
 light of <I>nature,</I> we see God as a God <I>above us;</I> by the 
 light of the <I>law,</I> we see him as a God <I>against us;</I> but by 
 the light of the gospel, we see him as <I>Immanuel,</I> God <I>with 
 us,</I> in our own nature, and (which is more) in our interest. Herein 
 the Redeemer <I>commended his love.</I> With Christ's name, 
 <I>Immanuel,</I> we may compare the name given to the gospel church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+48:35">Ezek. xlviii. 35</A>).

 <I>Jehovah Shammah--The Lord is there;</I> the Lord of hosts is with
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nor is it improper to say that the prophecy which foretold that he 
 should be called <I>Immanuel</I> was fulfilled, in the design and 
 intention of it, when he was called <I>Jesus;</I> for if he had not 
 been <I>Immanuel--God with us,</I> he could not have been <I>Jesus--a
 Saviour;</I> and herein consists the salvation he wrought out, in the 
 <I>bringing of God and man together;</I> this was what he designed, to 
 bring <I>God</I> to be <I>with us,</I> which is our great happiness, 
 and to bring <I>us</I> to <I>be with God,</I> which is our great 
 duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Joseph's obedience to the divine precept 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>).

 <I>Being raised from sleep</I> by the impression which the dream made
 upon him, <I>he did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him,</I> though 
 it was contrary to his former sentiments and intentions; <I>he took 
 unto him his wife;</I> he did it speedily, without delay, and
 cheerfully, without dispute; he was not disobedient to the heavenly 
 vision. Extraordinary direction like this we are not now to expect; but 
 God has still ways of making known his mind in doubtful cases, by hints 
 of providence, debates of conscience, and advice of faithful friends; 
 by each of these, applying the general rules of the written word, we 
 should, therefore, in all the steps of our life, particularly the great 
 turns of it, such as this of Joseph's, take direction from God, and we 
 shall find it safe and comfortable to do as he bids us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The accomplishment of the divine promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>).

 <I>She brought forth her first-born</I> son. The circumstances of it
 are more largely related,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:1">Luke ii. 1</A>,

 &c. Note, That which is <I>conceived of the Holy Ghost</I> never proves
 <I>abortive,</I> but will certainly be <I>brought forth</I> in its 
 season. What is <I>of the will of the flesh,</I> and <I>of the will of 
 man,</I> often miscarries; but, if Christ be <I>formed</I> in the soul, 
 God himself has begun the good work which he will perform; what is 
 <I>conceived</I> in grace will no doubt be <I>brought forth</I> in 
 glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is here further observed, 

 1. That Joseph, though he solemnized the marriage with Mary, his 
 espoused wife, kept at a distance from her while she was with child of 
 this Holy thing; he <I>knew her not till she had brought him forth.</I> 
 Much has been said concerning the perpetual virginity of our Lord: 
 Jerome was very angry with Helvidius for denying it. It is certain that 
 it cannot be proved from scripture. Dr. <I>Whitby</I> inclines to
 think that when it is said, <I>Joseph knew her not till she had brought 
 forth her first-born,</I> it is intimated that, afterwards, the reason 
 ceasing, he lived with her, according to the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:10">Exod. xxi. 10</A>.

 2. That Christ was the <I>first-born;</I> and so he might be called
 though his mother had not any other children after him, according to 
 the language of scripture. Nor is it without a mystery that Christ is
 called her <I>first-born,</I> for he is the <I>first-born of every 
 creature,</I> that is, the Heir of all things; and he is the 
 <I>first-born among many brethren,</I> that in all things he may have 
 the pre-eminence. 

 3. That <I>Joseph called his name Jesus,</I> according to the direction
 given him. God having <I>appointed</I> him to be the Saviour, which was 
 intimated in his giving him the name <I>Jesus,</I> we must 
 <I>accept</I> of him to be our Saviour, and, in concurrence with that 
 appointment, we must call him <I>Jesus, our Saviour.</I></P>
