 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was a melancholy account which we had in the close of the foregoing 
 chapter of the dishonour done to our Lord Jesus, when the scribes and 
 Pharisees proclaimed him a traitor to their church, and put upon him 
 all the marks of ignominy they could: but the story of this chapter
 balances that, by giving us an account of the honour done to the 
 Redeemer, notwithstanding all that reproach thrown upon him. Thus the 
 one was set over against the other. Let us see what honours were heaped 
 on the head of the Lord Jesus, even in the depths of his humiliation. 
 
 I. Mary did him honour, by anointing his feet at the supper in Bethany, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. The common people did him honour, with their acclamations of joy,
 when he rode in triumph into Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:12-19">ver. 12-19</A>.

 III. The Greeks did him honour, by enquiring after him with a longing
 desire to see him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:20-26">ver. 20-26</A>.

 IV. God the Father did him honour, by a voice from heaven, bearing 
 testimony to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:27-36">ver. 27-36</A>.

 V. He had honour done him by the Old Testament prophets, who foretold 
 the infidelity of those that heard the report of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:37-41">ver. 37-41</A>.

 VI. He had honour done him by some of the chief rulers, whose 
 consciences witnessed for him, though they had not courage to own it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:42,43">ver. 42, 43</A>.

 VII. He claimed honour to himself, by asserting his divine mission, and
 the account he gave of his errand into the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:44-50">ver. 44-50</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany,
 where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the
 dead.
 &nbsp; 2  There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus
 was one of them that sat at the table with him.
 &nbsp; 3  Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,
 and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair:
 and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
 &nbsp; 4  Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's
 <I>son,</I> which should betray him,
 &nbsp; 5  Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and
 given to the poor?
 &nbsp; 6  This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he
 was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
 &nbsp; 7  Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying
 hath she kept this.
 &nbsp; 8  For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not
 always.
 &nbsp; 9  Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
 they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see
 Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
 &nbsp; 10  But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus
 also to death;
 &nbsp; 11  Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away,
 and believed on Jesus.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>kind visit</I> our Lord Jesus paid to his friends at Bethany, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He came up out of the country, <I>six days before the passover,</I> and 
 took up at Bethany, a town which, according to the computation of our 
 metropolis, lay so near Jerusalem as to be within the bills of 
 mortality. He lodged here with his friend Lazarus, whom he had lately 
 <I>raised from the dead.</I> His coming to Bethany now may be 
 considered,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As a preface to the passover he intended to celebrate, to which 
 reference is made in assigning the date of his coming: <I>Six days 
 before the passover.</I> Devout men set time apart before, to prepare 
 themselves for that solemnity, and thus it became our Lord Jesus to 
 <I>fulfil all righteousness.</I> Thus he has set us an example of 
 solemn self-sequestration, before the solemnities of the gospel 
 passover; let us hear the voice crying, <I>Prepare ye the way of the 
 Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As a voluntary exposing of himself to the fury of his enemies; now 
 that his hour was at hand he came within their reach, and freely 
 offered himself to them, though he had shown them how easily he could 
 evade all their snares. Note, 

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus was voluntary in his sufferings; his life was not 
 <I>forced</I> from him, but <I>resigned: Lo, I come.</I> As the 
 strength of his persecutors could not overpower him, so their subtlety 
 could not surprise him, but he died because he would. 

 (2.) As there is a time when we are allowed to shift for our own 
 preservation, so there is a time when we are called to hazard our lives 
 in the cause of God, as St. Paul, when he <I>went bound in the Spirit 
 to Jerusalem.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. As an instance of his kindness to his friends at Bethany, whom he 
 loved, and from whom he was shortly to be taken away. This was a 
 farewell visit; he came to take leave of them, and to leave with them 
 words of comfort against the day of trial that was approaching. Note, 
 Though Christ depart for a time from his people, he will give them 
 intimations that he departs in love, and not in anger. Bethany is here 
 described to be the town <I>where Lazarus was, whom he raised from the 
 dead.</I> The miracle wrought here put a new honour upon the place, and 
 made it remarkable. Christ came hither to observe what improvement was 
 made of this miracle; for where Christ works wonders, and shows signal 
 favours, he looks after them, to see whether the intention of them be 
 answered. Where he has sown plentifully, he observes whether it comes 
 up again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>kind entertainment</I> which his friends there gave him: 
 They <I>made him a supper</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 a great supper, a feast. It is queried whether this was the same with 
 that which is recorded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:6">Matt. xxiv. 6</A>,

 &c., in the house of Simon. Most commentators think it was; for the
 substance of the story and many of the circumstances agree; but that 
 comes in after what was said <I>two days</I> before the passover, 
 whereas this was done <I>six days</I> before; nor is it likely that 
 Martha should serve in any house but her own; and therefore I incline 
 with Dr. Lightfoot to think them different: that in Matthew on the 
 third day of the passover week, but this the seventh day of the week 
 before, being the Jewish sabbath, the night before he rode in triumph 
 into Jerusalem; that in the house of Simon; this of Lazarus. These two 
 being the most public and solemn entertainments given him in Bethany, 
 Mary probably graced them <I>both</I> with this token of her respect; 
 and what she <I>left</I> of her ointment this first time, when she 
 spent but a <I>pound</I> of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 she used that second time, when she <I>poured it all out,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:3">Mark xiv. 3</A>.
 
 Let us see the account of this entertainment.

 1. They <I>made him a supper;</I> for with them, ordinarily, supper was
 the best meal. This they did in token of their respect and gratitude, 
 for a feast is made for <I>friendship;</I> and that they might have an 
 opportunity of free and pleasant conversation with him, for a feast is 
 made for <I>fellowship.</I> Perhaps it is in allusion to this and the 
 like entertainments given to Christ in the days of his flesh that he 
 promises, to such as open the door of their hearts to him, that he will 
 <I>sup with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>.

 2. Martha <I>served;</I> she herself waited at table, in token of her 
 great respect to the Master. Though a person of some quality, she did 
 not think it below her to <I>serve,</I> when Christ sat at meat; nor 
 should we think it a dishonour or disparagement to us to stoop to any 
 service whereby Christ may be honoured. Christ had formerly reproved 
 Martha for being <I>troubled with much serving.</I> But she did not 
 therefore leave off serving, as some, who, when they are reproved for 
 one extreme, peevishly run into another; no, still she <I>served;</I> 
 not as then at a distance, but <I>within hearing</I> of Christ's 
 gracious words, reckoning those happy who, as the queen of Sheba said 
 concerning Solomon's servants, stood continually before him, to hear 
 his wisdom; better be a <I>waiter</I> at Christ's table than a 
 <I>guest</I> at the table of a prince. 

 3. Lazarus was <I>one of those that sat at meat.</I> It proved the
 truth of his resurrection, as it did of Christ's, that there were those 
 who did <I>eat and drink with him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:41">Acts x. 41</A>.

 Lazarus did not retire into a <I>wilderness</I> after his resurrection,
 as if, when he had made a visit to the other world, he must ever after 
 be a hermit in this; no, he conversed familiarly with people, as others 
 did. He <I>sat at meat,</I> as a monument of the miracle Christ had 
 wrought. Those whom Christ has <I>raised up</I> to a spiritual life are 
 made to <I>sit together with him.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:5,6">Eph. ii. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The particular respect which Mary showed him, above the rest, in 
 anointing his feet with sweet ointment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 She had a <I>pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,</I> which 
 probably she had by her for her own use; but the death and resurrection 
 of her brother had quite weaned her from the use of all such things, 
 and with this she <I>anointed the feet of Jesus,</I> and, as a further 
 token of her reverence for him and negligence of herself, she <I>wiped 
 them with her hair,</I> and this was taken notice of by all that were 
 present, for <I>the house was filled with the odour of the 
 ointment.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:16">Prov. xxvii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Doubtless she intended this as a token of her love to Christ, who 
 had given real tokens of his love to her and her family; and thus she 
 studies what she shall render. Now by this her love to Christ appears 
 to have been, 

 (1.) A <I>generous</I> love; so far from sparing necessary charges in 
 his service, she is as ingenious to <I>create</I> an occasion of 
 expense in religion as most are to avoid it. If she had any thing more 
 valuable than another, that must be brought out for the honour of 
 Christ. Note, Those who love Christ truly love him so much better than
 this world as to be willing to lay out the best they have for him. 

 (2.) A <I>condescending</I> love; she not only bestowed her ointment 
 upon Christ, but with her own hands poured it upon him, which she might 
 have ordered one of her servants to have done; nay, she did not, as 
 usual, anoint his <I>head</I> with it, but his <I>feet.</I> True love, 
 as it does not spare charges, so it does not spare pains, in honouring 
 Christ. Considering what Christ has done and suffered for us, we are 
 very ungrateful if we think any service too hard to do, or too mean to 
 stoop to, whereby he may <I>really</I> be glorified. 

 (3.) A <I>believing</I> love; there was faith working by this love, 
 faith in Jesus as the Messiah, the Christ, the Anointed, who, being 
 both priest and king, was anointed as Aaron and David were. Note, 
 <I>God's Anointed</I> should be <I>our Anointed.</I> Has God poured on 
 him the oil of gladness above his fellows? Let us pour on him the 
 ointment of our best affections above all competitors. By consenting to 
 Christ as <I>our</I> king, we must comply with God's designs, 
 appointing him <I>our head</I> whom he has appointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:11">Hos. i. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>filling of the house</I> with the pleasant <I>odour of the 
 ointment</I> may intimate to us, 

 (1.) That those who entertain Christ in their hearts and houses bring a 
 sweet odour into them; Christ's presence brings with it an ointment and 
 <I>perfume which rejoice the heart.</I> 

 (2.) Honours done to Christ are comforts to all his friends and 
 followers; they are to God and good men an offering of a 
 <I>sweet-smelling savour.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Judas's dislike of Mary's compliment, or token of her respect to 
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>,
 
 where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The person that carped at it was Judas, <I>one of his disciples;</I> 
 not one of their nature, but only one of their number. It is possible 
 for the worst of men to lurk under the disguise of the best profession; 
 and there are many who pretend to stand in relation to Christ who 
 really have no kindness for him. Judas was an apostle, a preacher of 
 the gospel, and yet one that discouraged and checked this instance of 
 pious affection and devotion. Note, It is sad to see the life of 
 religion and holy zeal frowned upon and discountenanced by such as are 
 bound by their office to assist and encourage it. But this was he that 
 should <I>betray Christ.</I> Note, Coldness of love to Christ, and a 
 secret contempt of serious piety, when they appear in professors of 
 religion, are sad presages of a final apostasy. Hypocrites, by less 
 instances of worldliness, discover themselves to be ready for a 
 compliance with greater temptations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The pretence with which he covered his dislike 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Why was not this ointment,</I> since it was designed for a pious 
 use, sold for three hundred pence" (8<I>l.</I> 10<I>s.</I> of our
 money), "and <I>given to the poor?</I>" 

 (1.) Here is a foul iniquity gilded over with a specious and plausible
 pretence, for Satan transforms himself into an angel of light. 

 (2.) Here is worldly wisdom passing a censure upon pious zeal, as
 guilty of imprudence and mismanagement. Those who value themselves upon 
 their <I>secular policy,</I> and undervalue others for their <I>serious 
 piety,</I> have more in them of the spirit of Judas than they would be 
 thought to have.

 (3.) Here is charity to the poor made a colour for opposing a piece of
 piety to Christ, and secretly made a cloak for covetousness. Many 
 excuse themselves from <I>laying out</I> in charity under pretence of 
 <I>laying up</I> for charity: whereas, if the clouds be full of rain, 
 they will <I>empty themselves.</I> Judas asked, <I>Why was it not given 
 to the poor?</I> To which it is easy to answer, Because it was better 
 bestowed upon the Lord Jesus. Note, We must not conclude that those do 
 no acceptable piece of service who do not do it in our way, and just as 
 we would have them; as if every thing must be adjudged imprudent and 
 unfit which does not take its measures from us and our sentiments.
 Proud men think all ill-advised who do not advise with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The detection and discovery of Judas's hypocrisy herein, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Here is the evangelist's remark upon it, by the direction of him who 
 <I>searches the heart: This he said, not that he cared for the 
 poor,</I> as he pretended, <I>but because he was a thief, and had the 
 bag.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It did not come from a principle of charity: <I>Not that he cared 
 for the poor.</I> He had no compassion towards them, no concern for 
 them: what were the poor to him any further than he might serve his own 
 ends by being overseer of the poor? Thus some warmly contend for the 
 <I>power</I> of the church, as others for its <I>purity,</I> when 
 perhaps it may be said, Not that they care for the church; it is all 
 one to them whether its <I>true interest</I> sink or swim, but under 
 the pretence of this they are advancing themselves. Simeon and Levi 
 pretended zeal for circumcision, <I>not that they cared</I> for the 
 seal of the covenant, any more than Jehu for the Lord of hosts, when he 
 said, <I>Come see my zeal.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It did come from a principle of covetousness. The truth of the
 matter was, this ointment being designed for his Master, he would 
 rather have had it in money, to be put in the common stock with which 
 he was entrusted, and then he knew what to do with it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Judas was treasurer of Christ's household, whence some think he 
 was called <I>Iscariot,</I> the <I>bag-bearer. First,</I> See what 
 <I>estate</I> Jesus and his disciples had to live upon. It was but 
 <I>little;</I> they had neither farms nor merchandise, neither barns 
 nor storehouses, only a <I>bag;</I> or, as some think the word 
 signifies, a <I>box,</I> or <I>coffer,</I> wherein they kept just 
 enough for their subsistence, giving the overplus, if any were, to the 
 poor; this they carried about with them, wherever they went. <I>Omnia 
 mea mecum porto--I carry all my property about me.</I> This bag was 
 supplied by the contributions of good people, and the Master and his 
 disciples had all <I>in common;</I> let this lessen our esteem of 
 worldly wealth, and deaden us to the punctilios of state and ceremony, 
 and reconcile us to a mean and despicable way of living, if this be our 
 lot, that it was our Master's lot; for our sakes he <I>became poor. 
 Secondly,</I> See who was the <I>steward</I> of the little they had; it 
 was Judas, he was purse-bearer. It was his office to receive and pay,
 and we do not find that he gave any account what markets he made. He
 was appointed to this office, either, 

 1. Because he was the least and lowest of all the disciples; it was not 
 Peter nor John that was made steward (though it was a place of trust 
 and profit), but Judas, the meanest of them. Note, Secular employments, 
 as they are a digression, so they are a degradation to a minister of 
 the gospel; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:4">1 Cor. vi. 4</A>.

 The prime-ministers of state in Christ's kingdom refused to be
 concerned in the revenue,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:2">Acts vi. 2</A>.

 2. Because he was desirous of the place. He loved in his heart to be
 fingering money, and therefore had the moneybag committed to him, 
 either,

 (1.) As a kindness, to please him, and thereby oblige him to be true to
 his Master. Subjects are sometimes disaffected to the government 
 because disappointed of their preferment; but Judas had no cause to 
 complain of this; the bag he chose, and the bag he had. Or, 

 (2.) In judgment upon him, to punish him for his secret wickedness; 
 that was put into his hands which would be a snare and trap to him. 
 Note, Strong inclinations to sin within are often justly punished with 
 strong temptations to sin without. We have little reason to be fond of 
 the bag, or proud of it, for at the best we are but stewards of it; and 
 it was Judas, one of an ill character, and born to be hanged (pardon 
 the expression), that was steward of the bag. <I>The prosperity of
 fools destroys them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Being trusted with the bag, he was <I>a thief,</I> that is, he had 
 a thievish disposition. The reigning love of money is 
 <I>heart-theft</I> as much as anger and revenge are 
 <I>heart-murder.</I> Or perhaps he had been really guilty of embezzling 
 his Master's stores, and converting to his own use what was given to 
 the public stock. And some conjecture that he was now contriving to 
 fill his pockets, and then run away and leave his Master, having heard 
 him speak so much of troubles approaching, to which he could by no 
 means reconcile himself. Note, Those to whom the management and 
 disposal of public money is committed have need to be governed by 
 steady principles of justice and honesty, that no blot cleave to their 
 hands; for though some make a jest of cheating the government, or the 
 church, or the country, if cheating be <I>thieving,</I> and, 
 communities being more considerable than particular persons, if robbing 
 them be the greater sin, the guilt of theft and the portion of thieves 
 will be found no jesting matter. Judas, who had betrayed his trust, 
 soon after betrayed his Master.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Christ's justification of what Mary did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 <I>Let her alone.</I> Hereby he intimated his acceptance of her 
 kindness (though he was perfectly mortified to all the delights of 
 sense, yet, as it was a token of her goodwill, he signified himself 
 well-pleased with it), and his care that she should not be molested in 
 it: <I>Pardon her,</I> so it may be read; "excuse her this once, if it 
 be an error it is an error of her love." Note, Christ would not have 
 those censured nor discouraged who sincerely design to please him, 
 though in their honest endeavours there be not all the discretion that 
 may be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:3">Rom. xiv. 3</A>.

 Though we would not do as they do, yet <I>let them alone.</I> For
 Mary's justification,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ puts a favourable construction upon what she did, which those 
 that condemned it were not aware of: <I>Against the day of my burying 
 she has kept this.</I> Or, <I>She has reserved this for the day of my 
 embalming;</I> so Dr. Hammond. "You do not grudge the ointment used for 
 the embalming of your dead friends, nor say that it should be sold, and 
 given to the poor. Now this anointing either was so <I>intended,</I> or 
 at least may be so <I>interpreted;</I> for the day of my burying is now 
 at hand, and she has anointed a body that is already <I>as good as 
 dead.</I>" Note, 

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus thought much and often of his own death and burial; 
 it would be good for us to do so too. 

 (2.) Providence does often so open a door of opportunity to good 
 Christians, and the Spirit of grace does so open their hearts, that the 
 expressions of their pious zeal prove to be more <I>seasonable,</I> and 
 more <I>beautiful,</I> than any foresight of their own could make them. 
 
 (3.) The grace of Christ puts kind comments upon the pious words and 
 actions of good people, and not only makes the best of what is amiss, 
 but makes the most of what is good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives a sufficient answer to Judas's objection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 (1.) It is so ordered in the kingdom of Providence that <I>the poor we 
 have always with us,</I> some or other that are proper objects of 
 charity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:11">Deut. xv. 11</A>);

 such there will be as long as there are in this lapsed state of mankind 
 so much folly and so much affliction. 

 (2.) It is so ordered in the kingdom of grace that the church should 
 not always have the bodily presence of Jesus Christ: "<I>Me you have 
 not always,</I> but only nor for a little time." Note, We need wisdom, 
 when two duties come in competition, to know which to give the 
 preference to, which must be determined by the circumstances. 
 Opportunities are to be improved, and those opportunities first and 
 most vigorously which are likely to be of the shortest continuance, and 
 which we see most speedily hastening away. That good duty which may be 
 done <I>at any time</I> ought to give way to that which cannot be done 
 but <I>just now.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The public notice which was taken of our Lord Jesus here at this 
 supper in Bethany 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Much people of the Jews knew that he was there,</I> for he was the 
 talk of the town, and <I>they came</I> flocking thither; the more 
 because he had lately absconded, and now broke out as the sun from 
 behind a dark cloud. 

 1. They came to see Jesus, whose name was very much magnified, and made
 considerable by the late miracle he had wrought in raising Lazarus.
 They came, not to hear him, but to gratify their curiosity with a sight
 of him here at Bethany, fearing he would not appear publicly, as he
 used to do, this passover. They came, not to seize him, or inform
 against him, though the government had prosecuted him to an outlawry,
 but to see him and show him respect. Note, There are some in whose
 affections Christ will have an interest, in spite of all the attempts
 of his enemies to misrepresent him. It being known where Christ was,
 multitudes came to him. Note, Where the king is there is the court;
 where Christ is there will the <I>gathering of the people be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:37">Luke xvii. 37</A>.

 2. They came to see Lazarus and Christ together, which was a very
 inviting sight. Some came for the confirmation of their faith in 
 Christ, to have the story perhaps from Lazarus's own mouth. Others came 
 only for the gratifying of their curiosity, that they might say they 
 had seen a man who had been dead and buried, and yet lived again; so 
 that Lazarus served for a <I>show,</I> these holy-days, to those who, 
 like the Athenians, spent their time in telling and hearing new things.
 Perhaps some came to put curious questions to Lazarus about the state 
 of the dead, to ask what news from the other world; we ourselves have 
 sometimes said, it may be, We would have gone a great way for one 
 hour's discourse with Lazarus. But if any came on this errand it is
 probable that Lazarus was silent, and gave them no account of his 
 voyage; at least, the scripture is silent, and gives us no account of 
 it; and we must not covet to be wise above what is written. But our 
 Lord Jesus was present, who was a much fitter person for them to apply 
 to than Lazarus; for if we hear not Moses and the prophets, Christ and 
 the apostles, if we heed not what they tell us concerning another 
 world, neither should we be persuaded though Lazarus rose from the 
 dead. We have a more sure word of prophecy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The indignation of the chief priests at the growing interest of 
 our Lord Jesus, and their plot to crush it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 They <I>consulted</I> (or decreed) <I>how they might put Lazarus also
 to death,</I> because that <I>by reason of him</I> (of what was done to 
 him, not of any thing he said or did) <I>many of the Jews went away, 
 and believed on Jesus.</I> Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How vain and unsuccessful their attempts against Christ had hitherto 
 been. They had done all they could to alienate the people from him, and 
 exasperate them against him, and yet many of the Jews, their 
 neighbours, their creatures, their admirers, were so overcome by the 
 convincing evidence of Christ's miracles that they <I>went away</I> 
 from the interest and party of the priests, went off from obedience to 
 their tyranny, <I>and believed on Jesus;</I> and it was by reason of 
 Lazarus; his resurrection put life into their faith, and convinced them 
 that this Jesus was undoubtedly the Messiah, and had life in himself, 
 and power to give life. This miracle confirmed them in the belief of 
 his other miracles, which they had heard he wrought in Galilee: what 
 was impossible to him that could raise the dead?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How absurd and unreasonable this day's vote was--that Lazarus must 
 be put to death. This is an instance of the most brutish rage that 
 could be; they were like a <I>wild bull in a net,</I> full of fury, and 
 laying about them without any consideration. It was a sign that they
 <I>neither feared God nor regarded man.</I> For, 

 (1.) If they had feared God, they would not have done such an act of 
 defiance to him. God will have Lazarus to live by miracle, and they
 will have him to die by malice. They cry, <I>Away with such a fellow, 
 it is not fit he should live,</I> when God had so lately sent him back 
 to the earth, declaring it highly fit he should live; what was this but 
 <I>walking contrary to God?</I> They would put Lazarus to death, and 
 challenge almighty power to raise him again, as if they could contend 
 with God, and try titles with the King of kings. Who has the keys of 
 death and the grave, he or they? <I>O c&aelig;ca malitia! Christus qui 
 suscitare potuit mortuum, non possit occisum.--Blind malice, to suppose 
 that Christ, who could raise one that had died a natural death, could 
 not raise one that had been slain!</I>--Augustine in loc. Lazarus is 
 singled out to be the object of their special hatred, because God has 
 distinguished him by the tokens of his peculiar love, as if they had 
 made a league offensive and defensive with death and hell, and resolved 
 to be severe upon all deserters. One would think that they should 
 rather have consulted how they might have joined in friendship with 
 Lazarus and his family, and by their mediation have reconciled 
 themselves to this Jesus whom they had persecuted; but the god of this 
 world had <I>blinded their minds.</I> 

 (2.) If they had regarded man, they would not have done such an act of 
 injustice to Lazarus, an innocent man, to whose charge they could not 
 pretend to lay any crime. What bands are strong enough to hold those
 who can so easily break through the most sacred ties of common justice, 
 and violate the maxims which even nature itself teaches? But the 
 support of their own tyranny and superstition was thought sufficient, 
 as in the church of Rome, not only to justify, but to consecrate the 
 greatest villanies, and make them meritorious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  On the next day much people that were come to the feast,
 when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
 &nbsp; 13  Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and
 cried, Hosanna: Blessed <I>is</I> the King of Israel that cometh in
 the name of the Lord.
 &nbsp; 14  And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it
 is written,
 &nbsp; 15  Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting
 on an ass's colt.
 &nbsp; 16  These things understood not his disciples at the first: but
 when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things
 were written of him, and <I>that</I> they had done these things unto
 him.
 &nbsp; 17  The people therefore that was with him when he called
 Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare
 record.
 &nbsp; 18  For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard
 that he had done this miracle.
 &nbsp; 19  The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye
 how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This story of Christ's riding in triumph to Jerusalem is recorded by 
 all the evangelists, as worthy of special remark; and in it we may 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The respect that was paid to our Lord Jesus by the common people, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>,
 
 where we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who they were that paid him this respect: <I>much people,</I> 
 <B><I>ochlos polys</I></B>--<I>a great crowd</I> of those that came up 
 to the feast; not the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but the country people 
 that came from remote parts to worship at the feast; the nearer the 
 temple of the Lord, the further from the Lord of the temple. They were 
 such as <I>came up to the feast.</I> 

 (1.) Perhaps they had been Christ's hearers in the country, and great 
 admirers of him there, and therefore were forward to testify their 
 respect to him at Jerusalem, where they knew he had many enemies. Note, 
 Those that have a true value and veneration for Christ will neither be 
 ashamed nor afraid to own him before men in any instance whereby they 
 may do him honour. 

 (2.) Perhaps they were those more <I>devout Jews</I> that came up to 
 the feast some time before, to purify themselves, that were more 
 inclined to religion than their neighbours, and these were they that 
 were so forward to honour Christ. Note, The more regard men have to
 God and religion in general, the better disposed they will be to 
 entertain Christ and his religion, which is not destructive but 
 perfective of all previous discoveries and institutions. They were not 
 the rulers, nor the great men, that went out to meet Christ, but the 
 commonalty; some would have called them a mob, a rabble: but Christ has 
 chosen the weak and foolish things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:27">1 Cor. i. 27</A>),

 and is honoured more by the multitude than by the magnificence of his 
 followers; for he values men by their souls, not their names and titles 
 of honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. On what occasion they did it: <I>They heard that Jesus was coming to 
 Jerusalem.</I> They had enquired for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:55,56"><I>ch.</I> xi. 55, 56</A>):

 <I>Will he not come up to the feast?</I> And now they hear he is
 coming; for none that seek Christ seek in vain. Now when they heard he 
 was coming, they bestirred themselves, to give him an agreeable 
 reception. Note, Tidings of the approach of Christ and his kingdom 
 should awaken us to consider what is the work of the day, that it may 
 be done in the day. Israel must prepare to meet <I>their God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:12">Amos iv. 12</A>),

 and the virgins to <I>meet the bridegroom.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In what way they expressed their respect; they had not the keys of 
 the city to present to him, nor the sword nor mace to carry before him, 
 none of the city music to compliment him with, but such as they had 
 they gave him; and even this despicable crowd was a faint resemblance 
 of that glorious company which John saw <I>before the throne, and 
 before the Lamb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9,10">Rev. vii. 9, 10</A>.

 Though these were not before the throne, they were before the Lamb, the 
 paschal Lamb, who now, according to the usual ceremony, four days 
 before the feast, was set apart to be sacrificed for us. There it is 
 said of that celestial choir,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they had palms in their hands, and so had these <I>branches 
 of palm-trees.</I> The palm-tree has ever been an emblem of victory and 
 triumph; Cicero calls one that had won many prizes <I>plurimarum 
 palmarum homo--a man of many palms.</I> Christ was now by his death to 
 conquer principalities and powers, and therefore it was fit that he 
 should have the victor's palm borne before him; though he was but 
 girding on the harness, yet he could boast as though he had put it off. 
 But this was not all; the carrying of palm-branches was part of the 
 ceremony of the feast of tabernacles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:40,Ne+8:15">Lev. xxiii. 40; Neh. viii. 15</A>),

 and their using this expression of joy in the welcome given to our Lord 
 Jesus intimates that all the feasts pointed at his gospel, had their 
 accomplishment in it, and particularly that of the feast of 
 tabernacles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:16">Zech. xiv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they <I>cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our 
 God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:10">Rev. vii. 10</A>);

 so did these here, they shouted before him, as is usual in popular 
 welcomes, <I>Hosanna, blessed is the king of Israel, that comes in the 
 name of the Lord;</I> and <I>hosanna</I> signifies <I>salvation.</I> It 
 is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:25,26">Ps. cxviii. 25, 26</A>.

 See how well acquainted these common people were with the scripture,
 and how pertinently they apply it to the Messiah. High thoughts of 
 Christ will be best expressed in scripture-words. Now in their 
 acclamations,

 [1.] They acknowledge our Lord Jesus to be the king of Israel, that 
 comes <I>in the name of the Lord.</I> Though he went now in poverty and 
 disgrace, yet, contrary to the notions their scribes had given them of 
 the Messiah, they own him to be a king, which bespeaks both his dignity 
 and honour, which we must adore; and his dominion and power, to which 
 we must submit. They own him to be, <I>First,</I> A rightful king, 
 coming in <I>the name of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>),

 sent of God, not only as a prophet, but as a king. <I>Secondly,</I>
 The promised and long-expected king, Messiah the prince, for he is 
 <I>king of Israel.</I> According to the light they had, they proclaimed 
 him king of Israel in the streets of Jerusalem; and, they themselves 
 being Israelites, hereby they avouched him for their king. 

 [2.] They heartily wish well to his kingdom, which is the meaning of 
 hosanna; let the king of Israel prosper, as when Solomon was crowned 
 they cried, <I>God save king Solomon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:39">1 Kings i. 39</A>.

 In crying hosanna they prayed for three things:--<I>First,</I> That his 
 kingdom might come, in the light and knowledge of it, and in the power 
 and efficacy of it. God speed the gospel plough. <I>Secondly,</I> That 
 it might conquer, and be victorious over all opposition,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Rev. vi. 2</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> That it might continue. Hosanna is, <I>Let the king
 live for ever;</I> though his kingdom may be disturbed, let it never be
 destroyed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:17">Ps. lxxii. 17</A>.

 [3.] They bid him welcome into Jerusalem: "<I>Welcome is he that
 cometh;</I> we are heartily glad to see him; <I>come in thou blessed of 
 the Lord;</I> and well may we attend with our blessings him who meets 
 us with his." This welcome is like that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:7-9">Ps. xxiv. 7-9</A>),

 <I>Lift up your heads, O ye gates.</I> Thus we must every one of us bid 
 Christ welcome into our hearts, that is, we must praise him, and be 
 well pleased in him. As we should be highly pleased with the being and 
 attributes of God, and his relation to us, so we should be with the 
 person and offices of the Lord Jesus, and his meditation between us and 
 God. Faith saith, <I>Blessed is he that cometh.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The posture Christ puts himself into for receiving the respect that 
 was paid him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>When he had found,</I> or procured, <I>a young ass,</I> he <I>sat 
 thereon.</I> It was but a poor sort of figure he made, he alone upon an 
 ass, and a crowd of people about him shouting <I>Hosanna.</I> 

 1. This was much more of state than he used to take; he used to travel
 on foot, but now was mounted. Though his followers should be willing to 
 take up with mean things, and not affect any thing that looks like 
 grandeur, yet they are allowed to use the service of the inferior 
 creatures, according as God in his providence gives particular 
 possession of those things over which, by his covenant with Noah and 
 his sons, he has given to man a general dominion. 

 2. Yet it was much less of state than the great ones of the world
 usually take. If he would have made a public entry, according to the
 state of a man of high degree, he should have rode in a chariot like 
 that of Solomon's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:9,10">Cant. iii. 9, 10</A>),

 with <I>pillars of silver,</I> the <I>bottom of gold,</I> and the 
 <I>covering of purple;</I> but, if we judge according to the fashion of 
 this world, to be introduced thus was rather a disparagement than any 
 honour to the king of Israel, for it seemed as if he would look great, 
 and knew not how. His kingdom was not of this world, and therefore came 
 not with outward pomp. He was now humbling himself, but in his exalted 
 state John sees him in a vision <I>on a white horse, with a bow and a 
 crown.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The fulfilling of the scripture in this: <I>As it is written, Fear 
 not, daughter of Sion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 This is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:19">Zech. ix. 19</A>.

 To him bore all the prophets witness, and particularly to this 
 concerning him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was foretold that Zion's king should come, should come <I>thus, 
 sitting on an ass's colt;</I> even this minute circumstance was 
 foretold, and Christ took care it should be punctually fulfilled. Note, 
 
 (1.) Christ is Zion's king; the holy hill of Zion was of old destined 
 to be the metropolis or royal city of the Messiah. 

 (2.) Zion's king does and will look after her, and come to her; though 
 for a short time he retires, in due time he returns. 

 (3.) Though he comes but slowly (an ass is slow-paced), yet he comes
 surely, and with such expressions of humility and condescension as 
 greatly encourage the addresses and expectations of his loyal subjects. 
 Humble supplicants may reach to speak with him. If this be a 
 discouragement to Zion, that her king appears in no greater state or 
 strength, let her know that though he comes to her riding on an ass's 
 colt, yet he goes forth against her enemies riding <I>on the heavens 
 for her help,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:26">Deut. xxxiii. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The daughter of Zion is therefore called upon to <I>behold her 
 king,</I> to take notice of him and his approaches; behold and wonder, 
 for he comes with observation, though not with outward show, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11">Cant. iii. 11</A>.

 <I>Fear not.</I> In the prophecy, Zion is told to rejoice greatly, and
 to shout, but here it is rendered, <I>Fear not.</I> Unbelieving fears 
 are enemies to spiritual joys; if they be cured, if they be conquered, 
 joy will come of course; Christ comes to his people to <I>silence</I> 
 their fears. If the case be so that we cannot reach to the exultations
 of joy, yet we should labour to get from under the oppressions of fear. 
 <I>Rejoice greatly;</I> at least, <I>fear not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The remark made by the evangelist respecting the disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>They understood not at first</I> why Christ did this, and how the 
 scripture was fulfilled; but when <I>Jesus was glorified,</I> and 
 thereupon the Spirit poured out, then they remembered that <I>these 
 things were written of him</I> in the Old Testament, and that they and 
 others had, in pursuance thereof, <I>done these things to him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See here the imperfection of the disciples in their infant state; 
 even <I>they understood not these things at first.</I> They did not 
 consider, when they fetched the ass and set him thereon, that they were 
 performing the ceremony of the inauguration of Zion's king. Now 
 observe, 

 (1.) The scripture is often fulfilled by the agency of those who have 
 not themselves an eye to the scripture in what they do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:4">Isa. xlv. 4</A>.
 
 (2.) There are many excellent things, both in the word and providence 
 of God, which the disciples themselves do not at first understand: not 
 at their first acquaintance with the things of God, while they <I>see 
 men as trees walking;</I> not at the first proposal of the things to 
 their view and consideration. That which afterwards is clear was at 
 first dark and doubtful. 

 (3.) It well becomes the disciples of Christ, when they are grown up to 
 maturity in knowledge, frequently to reflect upon the follies and 
 weaknesses of their first beginning, that free grace may have the glory 
 of their proficiency, and they may have compassion on the ignorant. 
 <I>When I was a child, I spoke as a child.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See here the improvement of the disciples in their adult state. 
 Though they had been children, they were not always so, but went on to 
 perfection. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) When they understood it: <I>When Jesus was glorified;</I> for, 
 
 [1.] Till then they did not rightly apprehend the nature of his 
 kingdom, but expected it to appear in external pomp and power, and 
 therefore knew not how to apply the scriptures which spoke of it to so 
 mean an appearance. Note, The right understanding of the spiritual 
 nature of Christ's kingdom, of its powers, glories, and victories, 
 would prevent our misinterpreting and misapplying the scriptures that 
 speak of it. 

 [2.] Till then the Spirit was not poured out, who was to lead them into 
 all truth. Note, The disciples of Christ are enabled to understand the 
 scriptures by the same Spirit that indited the scriptures. <I>The 
 spirit of revelation is</I> to all the saints a <I>spirit of 
 wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:17,18">Eph. i. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How they understood it; they compared the prophecy with the event, 
 and put them together, that they might mutually receive light from each 
 other, and so they came to understand both: <I>Then remembered they 
 that these things were written of him</I> by the prophets, consonant to 
 which they were done to him. Note, Such an admirable harmony there is 
 between the word and works of God that the remembrance of what is 
 written will enable us to understand what is done, and the observation 
 of what is done will help us to understand what is written. <I>As we 
 have heard, so have we seen.</I> The scripture is every day 
 fulfilling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The reason which induced the people to pay this respect to our Lord 
 Jesus upon his coming into Jerusalem, though the government was so much 
 set against him. It was because of the illustrious miracle he had 
 lately wrought in raising Lazarus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See here what account and what assurance they had of this miracle; 
 no doubt, the city rang of it, the report of it was in all people's 
 mouths. But those who considered it as a proof of Christ's mission, and 
 a ground of their faith in him, that they might be well satisfied of 
 the matter of fact, traced the report to those who were eye-witnesses 
 of it, that they might <I>know the certainty</I> of it by the utmost 
 evidence the thing was capable of: <I>The people therefore that</I> 
 stood by <I>when he called Lazarus</I> out of his grave, being found 
 out and examined, <I>bore record,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 They unanimously averred the thing to be true, beyond dispute or 
 contradiction, and were ready, if called to it, to depose it upon oath, 
 for so much is implied in the word <B><I>Emartyrei</I></B>. Note, The 
 truth of Christ's miracles was evidenced by incontestable proofs. It is 
 probable that those who had seen this miracle did not only assert it to 
 those who asked them, but published it unasked, that this might add to 
 the triumphs of this solemn day; and Christ's coming in now from 
 Bethany, where it was done, would put them in mind of it. Note, Those 
 who wish well to Christ's kingdom should be forward to proclaim what 
 they know that may redound to his honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What improvement they made of it, and what influence it had upon 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>For this cause,</I> as much as any other, <I>the people met him.</I> 
 
 (1.) Some, out of curiosity, were desirous to see one that had done 
 such a wonderful work. Many a good sermon he had preached in Jerusalem, 
 which drew not such crowds after him as this one miracle did. But, 

 (2.) Others, out of conscience, studied to do him honour, as one sent 
 of God. This miracle was reserved for one of the last, that it might 
 confirm those which went before, and might gain him this honour just 
 before his sufferings; Christ's works were all not only <I>well 
 done</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:7">Mark vii. 7</A>)
 
 but <I>well timed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The indignation of the Pharisees at all this; some of them, 
 probably, saw, and they all soon heard of, Christ's public entry. The 
 committee appointed to find out expedients to crush him thought they 
 had gained their point when he had retired unto privacy, and that he 
 would soon be forgotten in Jerusalem, but they now rage and fret when 
 they see they imagined but a <I>vain thing.</I> 

 1. They own that they had got no ground against him; it was plainly to
 be perceived that they <I>prevailed nothing.</I> They could not, with 
 all their insinuations, alienate the people's affections from him, nor 
 with their menaces restrain them from showing their affection to him. 
 Note, Those who oppose Christ, and fight against his kingdom, will be 
 made to perceive that they prevail nothing. God will accomplish his own 
 purposes in spite of them, and the little efforts of their impotent 
 malice. <I>You prevail nothing,</I> <B><I>ouk opheleite</I></B>--<I>you 
 profit nothing.</I> Note, There is nothing got by opposing Christ. 

 2. They own that he had got ground: <I>The world is gone after
 him;</I> there is a vast crowd attending him, a <I>world of people:</I> 
 an hyperbole common in most languages. Yet here, like Caiaphas, ere 
 they were aware, they prophesied that <I>the world would go after 
 him;</I> some of all sorts, some from all parts; nations shall be 
 discipled. But to what intent was this said?

 (1.) Thus they <I>express</I> their own vexation at the growth of his 
 interest; their envy makes them fret. If the <I>horn of the righteous 
 be exalted with honour, the wicked see it, and are grieved</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:9,10">Ps. cxii. 9, 10</A>);

 considering how great these Pharisees were, and what abundance of 
 respect was paid them, one would think they needed not grudge Christ so 
 inconsiderable a piece of honour as was now done him; but proud men 
 would monopolize honour, and have none share with them, like Haman. 
 
 (2.) Thus they excite themselves and one another, to a more vigorous 
 carrying on of the war against Christ. As if they should say, "Dallying 
 and delaying thus will never do. We must take some other and more 
 effectual course, to put a stop to this infection; it is time to try 
 our utmost skill and force, before the grievance grows past redress." 
 Thus the enemies of religion are made more resolute and active by being 
 baffled; and shall its friends be disheartened with every 
 disappointment, who know its cause is righteous and will at last be 
 victorious?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to
 worship at the feast:
 &nbsp; 21  The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of
 Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
 &nbsp; 22  Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and
 Philip tell Jesus.
 &nbsp; 23  And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the
 Son of man should be glorified.
 &nbsp; 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall
 into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it
 bringeth forth much fruit.
 &nbsp; 25  He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth
 his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
 &nbsp; 26  If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am,
 there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will
 <I>my</I> Father honour.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Honour is here paid to Christ by certain Greeks that enquired or him 
 with respect. We are not told what day of Christ's last week this was, 
 probably not the same day he rode into Jerusalem (for that day was 
 taken up in public work), but a day or two after.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are told who they were that paid this honour to our Lord Jesus: 
 <I>Certain Greeks among</I> the people who <I>came up to worship at the 
 feast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Some think they were <I>Jews of the dispersion,</I> some of the twelve 
 tribes that were scattered among the Gentiles, and were called 
 <I>Greeks,</I> Hellenist Jews; but others think they were Gentiles, 
 those whom they called <I>proselytes of the gate,</I> such as the 
 eunuch and Cornelius. Pure natural religion met with the best 
 assistance among the Jews, and therefore those among the Gentiles who 
 were piously inclined joined with them in their solemn meetings, as far 
 as was allowed them. There were devout worshippers of the true God even 
 among those that were strangers to the commonwealth of Israel. It was 
 in the latter ages of the Jewish church that there was this flocking of 
 the Gentiles to the temple at Jerusalem,--a happy presage of the taking 
 down of the partition-wall between Jews and Gentiles. The forbidding of 
 the priests to accept of any oblation or sacrifice from a Gentile 
 (which was done by Eleazar the son of Ananias, the high priest), 
 Josephus says, was one of those things that brought the Romans upon 
 them, <I>War</I> 2. 409-410. Though these Greeks, if uncircumcised, were
 not admitted to eat the passover, yet they came to <I>worship at the 
 feast.</I> We must thankfully use the privileges we have, though there 
 may be others from which we are shut out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What was the honour they paid him: they desired to be acquainted 
 with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Having come to worship at the feast, they desired to make the best use 
 they could of their time, and therefore applied to Philip, desiring 
 that he would put them in a way to get some personal converse with the 
 Lord Jesus. 

 1. Having a desire to see Christ, they were industrious in the use of
 proper means. They did not conclude it impossible, because he was so 
 much crowded, to get to speak with him, nor rest in bare wishes, but 
 resolved to try what could be done. Note, Those that would have the 
 knowledge of Christ must seek it. 

 2. They made their application to Philip, one of his disciples. Some
 think that they had acquaintance with him formerly, and that they lived 
 near Bethsaida in Galilee of the Gentiles; and then it teaches us that 
 we should improve our acquaintance with good people, for our increase 
 in the knowledge of Christ. It is good to know those who know the Lord.
 But if these Greeks had been near Galilee it is probable that they 
 would have attended Christ there, where he mostly resided; therefore I 
 think that they applied to him only because they saw him a close 
 follower of Christ, and he was the first they could get to speak with.
 It was an instance of the veneration they had for Christ that they made 
 an interest with one of his disciples for an opportunity to converse 
 with him, a sign that they looked upon him as some great one, though he 
 appeared mean. Those that would see Jesus by faith now that he is in 
 heaven must apply to his ministers, whom he had appointed for this 
 purpose, to guide poor souls in their enquiries after him. Paul must 
 send for Ananias, and Cornelius for Peter. The bringing of these Greeks 
 to the knowledge of Christ by the means of Philip signified the agency 
 of the apostles, and the use made of their ministry in the conversion 
 of the Gentiles to the faith and the discipling of the nations. 

 3. Their address to Philip was in short this: <I>Sir, we would see
 Jesus.</I> They gave him a title of respect, as one worthy of honour, 
 because he was in relation to Christ. Their business is, they would 
 <I>see Jesus;</I> not only see his face, that they might be able to 
 say, when they came home, they had seen one that was so much talked of 
 (it is probable they had seen him when he appeared publicly); but they 
 would have some free conversation with him, and be taught by him, for 
 which it was no easy thing to find him at leisure, his hands were so 
 full of public work. Now that they were come to worship at the feast, 
 they would see Jesus. Note, In our attendance upon holy ordinances, and 
 particularly the gospel passover, the great desire of our souls should 
 be to see Jesus; to have our acquaintance with him increased, our 
 dependence on him encouraged, our conformity to him carried on; to see 
 him as ours, to keep up communion with him, and derive communications 
 of grace from him: we miss of our end in coming if we do not see Jesus.
 
 4. Here is the report which Philip made of this to his Master,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 He tells Andrew, who was of Bethsaida likewise, and was a <I>senior 
 fellow</I> in the college of the apostles, contemporary with Peter, and 
 consults him what was to be done, whether he thought the motion would 
 be acceptable or no, because Christ had sometimes said that he was 
 <I>not sent but to the house of Israel.</I> They agree that it must be 
 made; but then he would have Andrew go along with him, remembering the 
 favourable acceptance Christ had promised them, in case <I>two of them 
 should agree touching any thing they should ask,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:19">Matt. xviii. 19</A>.

 Note, Christ's ministers should be helpful to one another and concur in
 helping souls to Christ: <I>Two are better than one.</I> It should seem 
 that Andrew and Philip brought this message to Christ when he was 
 teaching in public, for we read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)

 of the <I>people that stood by;</I> but he was seldom alone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's acceptance of this honour paid him, signified by what he 
 said to the people hereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>,

 &c., where he foretels both the honour which he himself should have in
 being followed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>)

 and the honour which those should have that followed him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.
 
 This was intended for the direction and encouragement of these Greeks, 
 and all others that desired acquaintance with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He foresees that plentiful harvest, in the conversion of the 
 Gentiles, of which this was as it were the first-fruits, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Christ said to the two disciples who spoke a good word for these 
 Greeks, but doubted whether they should speed or no, <I>The hour is 
 come when the Son of Man shall be glorified,</I> by the accession of 
 the Gentiles to the church, and in order to that he must be rejected of 
 the Jews. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The end designed hereby, and that is the glorifying of the 
 Redeemer: "And is it so? Do the Gentiles begin to enquire after me? 
 Does the morning-star appear to them? and that blessed 
 <I>say-spring,</I> which knows its place and time too, does that begin 
 to <I>take hold of the ends of the earth?</I> Then the hour is come for 
 the <I>glorifying of the Son of man.</I>" This was no surprise to 
 Christ, but a paradox to those about him. Note, 

 [1.] The calling, the effectual calling, of the Gentiles into the 
 church of God greatly redounded to the glory of the Son of man. The 
 multiplying of the redeemed was the magnifying of the Redeemer. 

 [2.] there was a time, a set time, an hour, a certain hour, for the 
 glorifying of the Son of man, which did come at last, when the days of 
 his humiliation were numbered and finished, and he speaks of the 
 approach of it with exultation and triumph: <I>The hour is 
 come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The strange way in which this end was to be attained, and that was 
 by the death of Christ, intimated in that similitude 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 
 "<I>Verily, verily, I say unto you,</I> you to whom I have spoken of my 
 death and sufferings, <I>except a corn of wheat</I> fall not only 
 <I>to,</I> but <I>into, the ground,</I> and <I>die,</I> and be buried 
 and lost, it <I>abideth alone,</I> and you never see any more of it; 
 but <I>if it die</I> according to the course of nature (otherwise it 
 would be a miracle) it <I>bringeth forth much fruit,</I> God giving to 
 every seed its own body." Christ is the corn of wheat, the most 
 valuable and useful grain. Now here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The necessity of Christ's humiliation intimated. He would never 
 have been the living quickening head and root of the church if he had 
 not descended from heaven to this accursed earth and ascended from 
 earth to the accursed tree, and so accomplished our redemption. He must 
 <I>pour out his soul unto death,</I> else he cannot <I>divide a portion 
 with the great,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:12">Isa. liii. 12</A>.

 He shall have a seed given him, but he must shed his blood to purchase
 them and purify, must win them and wear them. It was necessary likewise 
 as a qualification for that glory which he was to have by the accession 
 of multitudes to his church; for if he had not by his sufferings made 
 satisfaction for sin, and so brought in an everlasting righteousness, 
 he would not have been sufficiently provided for the entertainment of 
 those that should come to him, and therefore must <I>abide 
 alone.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The advantage of Christ's humiliation illustrated. He <I>fell to 
 the ground</I> in his incarnation, seemed to be buried alive in this 
 earth, so much was his glory veiled; but this was not all: <I>he 
 died.</I> This immortal seed submitted to the laws of mortality, he lay 
 in the grave like seed under the clods; but as the seed comes up again 
 green, and fresh, and flourishing, and with a great increase, so one 
 dying Christ gathered to himself thousands of living Christians, and he 
 became their root. The salvation of souls hitherto, and henceforward
 to the end of time, is all owing to the dying of this <I>corn of 
 wheat.</I> Hereby the Father and the Son are glorified, the church is 
 replenished, the mystical body is kept up, and will at length be 
 completed; and, when time shall be no more, the Captain of our 
 salvation, <I>bringing many sons to glory</I> by the virtue of his 
 death, and being so made perfect by sufferings, shall be celebrated for 
 ever with the admiring praises of saints and angels, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10,13">Heb. ii. 10, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He foretels and promises an abundant recompence to those who should 
 cordially embrace him and his gospel and interest, and should make it 
 appear that they do so by their faithfulness in suffering for him or in 
 serving him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In suffering for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>He that loves his life</I> better than Christ <I>shall lose it;</I> 
 but he that hates <I>his life in this world,</I> and prefers the favour 
 of God and an interest in Christ before it, shall <I>keep it unto life 
 eternal.</I> This doctrine Christ much insisted on, it being the great 
 design of his religion to wean us from this world, by setting before us 
 another world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] See here the fatal consequences of an inordinate love of life; 
 many a man hugs himself to death, and loses his life by over-loving it. 
 He that so loves his animal life as to indulge his appetite, and make 
 <I>provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof,</I> shall 
 thereby shorten his days, shall lose the life he is so fond of, and 
 another infinitely better. He that is so much in love with the life of 
 the body, and the ornaments and delights of it, as, for fear of 
 exposing it or them, to deny Christ, he shall lose it, that is, lose a 
 real happiness in the other world, while he thinks to secure an 
 imaginary one in this. <I>Skin for skin</I> a man may give for his 
 life, and make a good bargain, but he that gives his soul, his God, his 
 heaven, for it, buys life too dear, and is guilty of the folly of him 
 who sold a birth-right for a mess of pottage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] See also the blessed recompence of a holy contempt of life. He 
 that so hates the life of the body as to venture it for the preserving 
 of the life of his soul shall find both, with unspeakable advantage, in 
 eternal life. Note, <I>First,</I> It is required of the disciples of 
 Christ that they hate <I>their life in this world;</I> a life in this 
 world supposes a life in the other world, and this is hated when it is 
 loved less than that. Our life in this world includes all the 
 enjoyments of our present state, riches, honours, pleasures, and long 
 life in the possession of them; these we must hate, that is, despise 
 them as vain and insufficient to make us happy, dread the temptations 
 that are in them, and cheerfully part with them whenever they come in 
 competition with the service of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:24,21:13,Re+12:11">Acts xx. 24; xxi. 13; 
 Rev. xii. 11</A>.
 
 See here much of the <I>power of godliness</I>--that it conquers the 
 strongest natural affections; and much of the <I>mystery of 
 godliness</I>--that it is the greatest wisdom, and yet makes men hate 
 their own lives. <I>Secondly,</I> Those who, in love to Christ, hate 
 their own lives in this world, shall be abundantly recompensed in the 
 resurrection of the just. <I>He that hateth his life shall keep it;</I> 
 he puts it into the hands of one that will <I>keep it to life 
 eternal,</I> and restore it with as great an improvement as the 
 heavenly life can make of the earthly one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In serving him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>If any man</I> profess <I>to serve me,</I> let him <I>follow me,</I> 
 as a servant follows his master; and <I>where I am,</I> <B><I>ekei kai 
 ho diakonos ho emos estai</I></B>--there <I>let my servant be;</I> so 
 some read it, as part of the duty, there let him be, to attend upon me; 
 we read it as part of the promise, <I>there shall he be</I> in 
 happiness with me. And, lest this should seem a small matter, he adds, 
 <I>If any man serve me, him will my Father honour;</I> and that is 
 enough, more than enough. The Greeks desired to see Jesus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 but Christ lets them know that it was not enough to see him, they must 
 <I>serve him.</I> He did not come into the world, to be a show for us 
 to gaze at, but a king to be ruled by. And he says this for the 
 encouragement of those who enquired after him to become his servants.
 In taking servants it is usual to fix both the work and the wages; 
 Christ does both here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Here is the work which Christ expects from his servants; and it is 
 very easy and reasonable, and such as becomes them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Let them attend their Master's movements: <I>If any man 
 serve me, let him follow me.</I> Christians must follow Christ, follow 
 his methods and prescriptions, <I>do the things that he says,</I> 
 follow his example and pattern, <I>walk as he also walked,</I> follow 
 his conduct by his providence and Spirit. We must go whither he leads 
 us, and in the way he leads us; must follow the Lamb whithersoever he 
 goes before us. "If any man serve me, if he put himself into that 
 relation to me, let him apply himself to the business of my service, 
 and be always ready at my call." Or, "If any man do indeed serve me, 
 let him make an open and public profession of his relation to me, by 
 following me, as the servant owns his Master by following him in the 
 streets."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Let them attend their Master's repose: <I>Where I am, 
 there let my servant be,</I> to wait upon me. Christ is where his 
 church is, in the assemblies of his saints, where his ordinances are 
 administered; and <I>there let his servants be,</I> to present 
 themselves before him, and receive instructions from him. Or, "Where I 
 am to be in heaven, whither I am now going, there let the thoughts and 
 affections of my servants be, there let their conversation be, <I>where 
 Christ sitteth.</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:1,2">Col. iii. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Here are the wages which Christ promises to his servants; and they 
 are very rich and noble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> They shall be happy with him: <I>Where I am, there shall 
 also my servant be.</I> To be with him, when he was here in poverty and 
 disgrace, would seem but poor preferment, and therefore, doubtless, he 
 means being with him in paradise, sitting with him at his table above, 
 on his throne there; it is the happiness of heaven to be with Christ 
 there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 24</A>.

 Christ speaks of heaven's happiness as if he were already in it: Where
 <I>I am;</I> because he was sure of it, and near to it, and it was 
 still <I>upon his heart,</I> and <I>in his eye.</I> And the same joy 
 and glory which he thought recompence enough for all his services and 
 sufferings are proposed to his servants as the recompence of theirs. 
 Those that follow him in the way shall be with him in the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> They shall be honoured by his Father; he will make 
 them amends for all their pains and loss, by conferring an honour upon 
 them, such as becomes a great God to give, but far beyond what such 
 worthless worms of the earth could expect to receive. The rewarder is 
 God himself, who takes the services done to the Lord Jesus as done to 
 himself. The reward is honour, true lasting honour, the highest honour; 
 it is the honour that comes from God. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:18">Prov. xxvii. 18</A>),

 <I>He that waits on his Master</I> (humbly and diligently) <I>shall be
 honoured.</I> Those that wait on Christ God will put honour upon, such 
 as will be taken notice of another day, though now under a veil. Those 
 that serve Christ must humble themselves, and are commonly vilified by 
 the world, in recompence of both which they shall be exalted in due 
 time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus far Christ's discourse has reference to those Greeks who desired 
 to <I>see him,</I> encouraging them to serve him. What became of those 
 Greeks we are not told, but are willing to hope that those who thus 
 asked the way to heaven with their faces thitherward, found it, and 
 walked in it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save
 me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
 &nbsp; 28  Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from
 heaven, <I>saying,</I> I have both glorified <I>it,</I> and will glorify
 <I>it</I> again.
 &nbsp; 29  The people therefore, that stood by, and heard <I>it,</I> said
 that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.
 &nbsp; 30  Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me,
 but for your sakes.
 &nbsp; 31  Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of
 this world be cast out.
 &nbsp; 32  And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <I>men</I>
 unto me.
 &nbsp; 33  This he said, signifying what death he should die.
 &nbsp; 34  The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
 Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must
 be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
 &nbsp; 35  Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light
 with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon
 you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he
 goeth.
 &nbsp; 36  While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be
 the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed,
 and did hide himself from them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Honour is here done to Christ by his Father in a voice from heaven,
 occasioned by the following part of his discourse, and which gave
 occasion to a further conference with the people. In these verses we 
 have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's address to his Father, upon occasion of the trouble which 
 seized his spirit at this time: <I>Now is my soul troubled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 
 A strange word to come from Christ's mouth, and at this time 
 surprising, for it comes in the midst of divers pleasing prospects, in 
 which, one would think, he should have said, Now is my soul 
 <I>pleased.</I> Note, Trouble of soul sometimes follows after great 
 enlargements of spirit. In this world of mixture and change we must 
 expect damps upon our joy, and the highest degree of comfort to be the 
 next degree to trouble. When Paul had been in the third heavens, he had 
 a <I>thorn in the flesh.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ's dread of his approaching sufferings: <I>Now is my soul 
 troubled.</I> Now the black and dismal scene began, now were the first 
 throes of the travail of his soul, now his agony began, his soul 
 <I>began to be exceedingly sorrowful.</I> Note, 

 (1.) The sin of our soul was the trouble of Christ's soul, when he 
 undertook to redeem and save us, and to make his soul an offering for 
 our sin. 

 (2.) The trouble of his soul was designed to ease the trouble of our 
 souls; for, after this, he said to his disciples

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:1"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 1</A>),

 "<I>Let not your hearts be troubled;</I> why should yours be troubled
 and mine too?" Our Lord Jesus went on cheerfully in his work, in 
 prospect of the joy set before him, and yet submitted to a trouble of 
 soul. Holy mourning is consistent with spiritual joy, and the way to 
 eternal joy. Christ was <I>now</I> troubled, now in sorrow, now in 
 fear, now for a season; but it would not be so always, it would not be 
 so long. The same is the comfort of Christians in their troubles; they 
 are but <I>for a moment,</I> and will be turned into joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The strait he seems to be in hereupon, intimated in those words, 
 <I>And what shall I say?</I> This does not imply his consulting with 
 any other, as if he needed advice, but considering with himself what 
 was fit to be said now. When our souls are troubled we must take heed 
 of speaking unadvisedly, but debate with ourselves what we shall say. 
 Christ speaks like one at a loss, as if what he should choose he wot 
 not. There was a struggle between the work he had taken upon him, which 
 required sufferings, and the nature he had taken upon him, which 
 dreaded them; between these two he here pauses with, <I>What shall I 
 say?</I> He looked, and there was <I>none to help,</I> which put him to 
 a stand. Calvin observes this as a great instance of Christ's 
 humiliation, that he should speak thus like one at a loss. <I>Quo se 
 magis exinanivit glori&aelig; Dominus, eo luculentius habemus erga nos
 amoris specimen--The more entirely the Lord of glory emptied himself, 
 the brighter is the proof of the love he bore us.</I> Thus he was <I>in 
 all points tempted like as we are,</I> to encourage us, when we know 
 not what to do, to direct our eyes to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His prayer to God in this strait: <I>Father, save me from this 
 hour,</I> <B><I>ek tes oras tautes</I></B>--<I>out of this hour,</I> 
 praying, not so much that it might not come as that he might be brought 
 through it. <I>Save me from this hour;</I> this was the language of
 innocent nature, and its feelings poured forth in prayer. Note, It is 
 the duty and interest of troubled souls to have recourse to God by 
 faithful and fervent prayer, and in prayer to eye him as a Father.
 Christ was voluntary in his sufferings, and yet prayed to be saved from 
 them. Note, Prayer against a trouble may very well consist with 
 patience under it and submission to the will of God in it. Observe, He 
 calls his suffering <I>this hour,</I> meaning the expected events of 
 the time now at hand. Hereby he intimates that the time of his 
 suffering was, 

 (1.) A set time, set to an hour, and he knew it. It was said twice 
 before that his hour was not yet come, but it was now so near that he 
 might say it was come. 

 (2.) A short time. An hour is soon over, so were Christ's sufferings; 
 he could see through them to the <I>joy set before him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. His acquiescence in his Father's will, notwithstanding. He presently 
 corrects himself, and, as it were, recalls what he had said: <I>But for 
 this cause came I to this hour.</I> Innocent nature got the first word, 
 but divine wisdom and love got the last. Note, those who would proceed 
 regularly must go upon second thoughts. The complainant speaks first; 
 but, if we would judge righteously, we must hear the other side. With 
 the second thought he checked himself: <I>For this cause came I to this 
 hour;</I> he does not silence himself with this, that he could not 
 avoid it, there was no remedy; but satisfies himself with this, that he 
 would not avoid it, for it was pursuant to his own voluntary 
 engagement, and was to be the crown of his whole undertaking; should he 
 now fly off, this would frustrate all that had been done hitherto. 
 Reference is here had to the divine counsels concerning his sufferings, 
 by virtue of which it behoved him thus to submit and suffer. Note, This 
 should reconcile us to the darkest hours of our lives, that we were all 
 along designed for them; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:3">1 Thess. iii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. His regard to his Father's honour herein. Upon the withdrawing of 
 his former petition, he presents another, which he will abide by: 
 <I>Father, glorify thy name,</I> to the same purport with <I>Father, 
 thy will be done;</I> for God's will is for his own glory. This 
 expresses more than barely a submission to the will of God; it is a 
 consecration of his sufferings to the glory of God. It was a 
 mediatorial word, and was spoken by him as our surety, who had
 undertaken to satisfy divine justice for our sin. The wrong which by
 sin we have done to God is in his glory, his declarative glory; for in
 nothing else are we capable of doing him injury. We were never able to
 make him satisfaction for this wrong done him, nor any creature for us;
 nothing therefore remained but that God should get him honour upon us
 in our utter ruin. Here therefore our Lord Jesus interposed, undertook
 to satisfy God's injured honour, and he did it by his humiliation; he
 denied himself in, and divested himself of, the honours due to the Son
 of God incarnate, and submitted to the greatest reproach. Now here he
 makes a tender of this satisfaction as an equivalent: "<I>Father,
 glorify thy name;</I> let thy justice be honoured upon the sacrifice,
 not upon the sinner; let the debt be levied upon me, I am solvent, the
 principal is not." Thus he <I>restored that which he took not
 away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Father's answer to this address; for he heard him always, and
 does still. Observe, 

 1. How this answer was given. By a voice from heaven. The Jews speak
 much of a <I>Bath-k&ocirc;l--the daughter of a voice,</I> as one of 
 those divers manners by which God in time past spoke to the prophets; 
 but we do not find any instance of his speaking thus to any but to our 
 Lord Jesus; it was an honour reserved for him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17,17:5">Matt. iii. 17; xvii. 5</A>),

 and here, probably, this audible voice was introduced by some visible 
 appearance, either of light or darkness, for both have been used as 
 vehicles of the divine glory. 

 2. What the answer was. It was an express return to that petition,
 <I>Father, glorify thy name: I have glorified it</I> already, and <I>I 
 will glorify it yet again.</I> When we pray as we are taught, <I>Our 
 Father, hallowed be thy name,</I> this is a comfort to us, that is it 
 an answered prayer; answered to Christ here, and in him to all true 
 believers.

 (1.) The name of God had been glorified in the life of Christ, in his 
 doctrine and miracles, and all the examples he gave of holiness and 
 goodness. 

 (2.) It should be further glorified in the death and sufferings of 
 Christ. His wisdom and power, his justice and holiness, his truth and 
 goodness, were greatly glorified; the demands of a broken law were 
 fully answered; the affront done to God's government satisfied for; and 
 God accepted the satisfaction, and declared himself well pleased. What 
 God has done for the glorifying of his own name is an encouragement to 
 us to expect what he will yet further do. He that has secured the 
 interests of his own glory will still secure them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The opinion of the standers-by concerning this voice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 We may hope there were some among them whose minds were so well 
 prepared to receive a divine revelation that they understood what was 
 said and bore record of it. But notice is here taken of the perverse 
 suggestion of the multitude: some of them said that <I>it 
 thundered:</I> others, who took notice that there was plainly an 
 articulate intelligible voice, said that certainly <I>an angel spoke to 
 him.</I> Now this shows, 

 1. That it was a real thing, even in the judgment of those that were
 not at all well affected to him. 

 2. That they were loth to admit so plain a proof of Christ's divine
 mission. They would rather say that it was this, or that, or any
 thing, than that God spoke to him in answer to his prayer; and yet, if 
 it thundered with articulate sounds (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:3,4">Rev. x. 3, 4</A>),

 was not that God's voice? Or, if angels spoke to him, are not they 
 God's messengers? But thus <I>God speaks once, yea twice, and man 
 perceives it not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The account which our Saviour himself gives of this voice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Why it was sent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "It came <I>not because of me,</I> not merely for my encouragement and 
 satisfaction" (then it might have been whispered in his ear privately), 
 "<I>but for your sakes.</I>" 

 (1.) "That all you who heard it may <I>believe that the Father hath 
 sent me.</I>" What is said from heaven concerning our Lord Jesus, and 
 the glorifying of the Father in him, is said for our sakes, that we may 
 be brought to submit to him and rest upon him. 

 (2.) "That you my disciples, who are to follow me in sufferings, may 
 therein be comforted with the same comforts that carry me on." Let this 
 encourage them to part with life itself for his sake, if they be called 
 to it, that it will redound to the honour of God. Note, The promises
 and supports granted to our Lord Jesus in his sufferings were intended 
 for our sakes. <I>For our sakes</I> he <I>sanctified himself,</I> and 
 <I>comforted himself.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was the meaning of it. He that lay in the Father's bosom knew 
 his voice, and what was the meaning of it; and two things God intended 
 when he said that he would <I>glorify his own name:</I>--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That by the death of Christ Satan should be conquered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):
 
 <I>Now is the judgment.</I> He speaks with a divine exultation and 
 triumph. "Now the year of my redeemed is come, and the time prefixed 
 for breaking the serpent's head, and giving a total rent to the powers 
 of darkness; now for that glorious achievement: <I>now, now,</I> that 
 great work is to be done which has been so long thought of in the 
 divine counsels, so long talked of in the written word, which has been 
 so much the hope of saints and the dread of devils." The matter of the 
 triumph is, 

 [1.] That <I>now is the judgment of the world;</I> 
 <B><I>krisis</I></B>, take it as a medical term: "Now is the 
 <I>crisis</I> of this world." The sick and diseased world is now upon 
 the turning point; this is the critical day upon which the trembling 
 scale will turn for life or death, to all mankind; all that are not 
 recovered by this will be left helpless and hopeless. Or, rather, it is 
 a law term, as we take it: "Now, judgment is entered, in order to the 
 taking out of execution against the prince of this world." Note, The 
 death of Christ was the <I>judgment of this world. First,</I> It is a 
 judgment of discovery and distinction--<I>judicium discretionis;</I> so 
 Austin. Now is the trial of this world, for men shall have their
 character according as the cross of Christ is to them; to some it is 
 foolishness and a stumbling-block, to others it is the wisdom and power 
 of God; of which there was a figure in the two thieves that were 
 crucified with him. By this men are judged, what they think of the 
 death of Christ. <I>Secondly,</I> It is a judgment of favour and
 absolution to the chosen ones that are in the world. Christ upon the 
 cross interposed between a righteous God and a guilty world as a 
 sacrifice for sin and a surety for sinners, so that when he was judged, 
 and <I>iniquity laid upon him,</I> and he was wounded for our 
 transgressions, it was as it were the judgment of this world, for an 
 everlasting righteousness was thereby brought in, not for Jews only, 
 but the whole world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1,2,Da+9:24">1 John ii. 1, 2; Dan. ix. 24</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> It is a judgment of condemnation given against the
 powers of darkness; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:11"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 11</A>.

 Judgment is put for vindication and deliverance, the asserting of an
 invaded right. At the death of Christ there was a famous trial between 
 Christ and Satan, the serpent and the promised seed; the trial was for 
 the world, and the lordship of it; the devil had long borne sway among 
 the children of men, time out of mind; he now pleads prescription, 
 grounding his claim also upon the forfeiture incurred by sin. We find 
 him willing to have come to a composition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:6,7">Luke iv. 6, 7</A>);

 he would have given the kingdoms of this world to Christ, provided he 
 would hold them by, from, and under him. But Christ would try it out 
 with; by dying he takes off the forfeiture to divine justice, and then 
 fairly disputes the title, and recovers it in the court of heaven.
 Satan's dominion is declared to be a usurpation, and the world adjudged 
 to the Lord Jesus as his right, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6,8">Ps. ii. 6, 8</A>.

 The judgment of this world is, that it belongs to Christ, and not to 
 Satan; to Christ therefore let us all <I>atturn</I> tenants. 

 [2.] That <I>now is the prince of this world cast out. First,</I> It is 
 the devil that is here called the <I>prince of this world,</I> because 
 he rules over the men of the world by the things of the world; he is 
 the <I>ruler of the darkness of this world,</I> that is, of this dark 
 world, of those in it that <I>walk in darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:4,Eph+4:12">2 Cor. iv. 4; Eph. iv. 12</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> He is said to be <I>cast out,</I> to be <I>now</I>
 cast out; for, whatever had been done hitherto towards the weakening of 
 the devil's kingdom was done in the virtue of a Christ to come, and 
 therefore is said to be done <I>now.</I> Christ, reconciling the world 
 to God by the merit of his death, broke the power of death, and cast 
 out Satan as a destroyer; Christ, reducing the world to God by the 
 doctrine of his cross, broke the power of sin, and cast out Satan as a 
 deceiver. The bruising of his heel was the breaking of the serpent's 
 head, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>.

 When his oracles were silenced, his temples forsaken, his idols
 famished, and the kingdoms of the world became Christ's kingdoms, then 
 was the <I>prince of the world cast out,</I> as appears by comparing 
 this with John's vision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:8-11">Rev. xii. 8-11</A>),

 where it is said to be done by the <I>blood of the Lamb.</I> Christ's 
 frequent casting of devils out of the bodies of people was an 
 indication of the great design of his whole undertaking. Observe, With
 what assurance Christ here speaks of the victory over Satan; it is as 
 good as done, and even when he yields to death he triumphs over it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That by the death of Christ souls should be converted, and this 
 would be the casting out of Satan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me.</I> 
 Here observe two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The great design of our Lord Jesus, which was to <I>draw all men 
 to him,</I> not the Jews only, who had been long in a profession a 
 people <I>near to God,</I> but the Gentiles also, who had been <I>afar 
 off;</I> for he was to be the <I>desire of all nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:7">Hag. ii. 7</A>),
 
 and <I>to him must the gathering of the people be.</I> That which his 
 enemies dreaded was that the world would go after him; and he would 
 draw them to him, notwithstanding their opposition. Observe here how 
 Christ himself is all in all in the conversion of a soul. <I>First,</I> 
 It is Christ that draws: I <I>will draw.</I> It is sometimes ascribed 
 to the Father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:44"><I>ch.</I> vi. 44</A>),

 but here to the Son, who is the <I>arm of the Lord.</I> He does not
 drive by force, but draws with the <I>cords of a man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:4,Jer+31:3">Hos. xi. 4; Jer. xxxi. 3</A>),

 draws as the loadstone; the soul is <I>made willing,</I> but it is in a
 <I>day of power. Secondly,</I> It is to Christ that we are drawn: "I 
 will draw them to me as the centre of their unity." The soul that was 
 at a distance from Christ is brought into an acquaintance with him, he 
 that was shy and distrustful of him is brought to love him and trust in 
 him,--drawn up to his terms, into his arms. Christ was now going to 
 heaven, and he would draw men's hearts to him thither.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The strange method he took to accomplish his design by <I>being 
 lifted up from the earth.</I> What he meant by this, to prevent 
 mistake, we are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>This he spoke signifying by what death he should die,</I> the death 
 of the cross, though they had designed and attempted to stone him to 
 death. He that was crucified was first nailed to the cross, and then 
 lifted up upon it. He was <I>lifted up as a spectacle to the world;</I> 
 lifted up between heaven and earth, as unworthy of either; yet the word 
 here used signifies an honourable advancement, <B><I>ean 
 hypsotho</I></B>--<I>If I be exalted;</I> he reckoned his sufferings 
 his honour. Whatever death we die, if we die in Christ we shall be 
 lifted up out of this dungeon, this den of lions, into the regions of 
 light and love. We should learn of our Master to speak of dying with a 
 holy pleasantness, and to say, "We shall then be lifted up." Now 
 Christ's drawing all men to him followed his being <I>lifted up from 
 the earth. First,</I> It followed after it in time. The great increase
 of the church was after the death of Christ; while Christ lived, we 
 read of thousands at a sermon miraculously fed, but after his death we 
 read of thousands at a sermon added to the church. Israel began to
 multiply in Egypt after the death of Joseph. <I>Secondly,</I> It
 followed upon it as a blessed consequence of it. Note, There is a
 powerful virtue and efficacy in the death of Christ to draw souls to 
 him. The cross of Christ, though to some a <I>stumbling-stone,</I> is 
 to others a <I>loadstone.</I> Some make it an allusion to the drawing 
 of fish into a net; the lifting up of Christ was as the spreading of 
 the net 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:47,48">Matt. xiii. 47, 48</A>);

 or to the setting up of a standard, which draws soldiers together; or, 
 rather, it refers to the lifting up of the brazen serpent in the 
 wilderness, which drew all those to it who were stung with fiery 
 serpents, as soon as ever it was known that it was lifted up, and there 
 was healing virtue in it. O what flocking was there to it! So there was 
 to Christ, when salvation through him was preached to all nations; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:14,15"><I>ch.</I> iii. 14, 15</A>.

 Perhaps it has some reference to the posture in which Christ was
 crucified, with his arms stretched out, to invite all to him, and 
 embrace all that come. Those that put Christ to that ignominious death 
 thought thereby to drive all men from him; but the devil was outshot in 
 his own bow. <I>Out of the eater came forth meat.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The people's exception against what he said, and their cavil at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Though they had heard the voice from heaven, and the gracious words 
 that proceeded out of his mouth, yet they object, and pick quarrels 
 with him. Christ had called himself the <I>Son of man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 which they knew to be one of the titles of the Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13">Dan. vii. 13</A>.
 
 He had also said that the <I>Son of man must be lifted up,</I> which 
 they understood of his dying, and probably he explained himself so, and 
 some think he repeated what he said to Nicodemus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:14"><I>ch.</I> iii. 14</A>),

 <I>So must the Son of man be lifted up.</I> Now against this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They alleged those scriptures of the Old Testament which speak of 
 the perpetuity of the Messiah, that he should be so far from being cut 
 off in the midst of his days that he should be a <I>priest for ever</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:4">Ps. cx. 4</A>),
 
 and a king <I>for ever</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:29">Ps. lxxxix. 29</A>,

 &c.), that he should have <I>length of days for ever and ever,</I> and
 <I>his years as many generations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:4,61:6">Ps. xxi. 4; lxi. 6</A>),

 from all which they inferred that the Messiah should not die. Thus 
 great knowledge in the letter of the scripture, if the heart be 
 unsanctified, is capable of being abused to serve the cause of 
 infidelity, and to fight against Christianity with its own weapons. 
 Their perverseness in opposing this to what Jesus had said will appear 
 if we consider, 

 (1.) That, when they vouched the scripture to prove that the Messiah 
 <I>abideth for ever,</I> they took no notice of those texts which speak 
 of the Messiah's death and sufferings: they had heard out of the law 
 that <I>Messiah abideth for ever;</I> and had they never heard out of 
 the law that Messiah should <I>be cut off</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:26">Dan. ix. 26</A>),

 and that he should <I>pour out his soul unto death</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:12">Isa. liii. 12</A>),
 
 and particularly that his <I>hands and feet</I> should be pierced? Why 
 then do they make so strange of the <I>lifting up of the Son of 
 man?</I> Note, We often run into great mistakes, and then defend them 
 with scripture arguments, by putting those things asunder which God in 
 his word has put together, and opposing one truth under pretence of 
 supporting another. We have heard out of the gospel that which exalts 
 free grace, we have heard also that which enjoins duty, and we just 
 cordially embrace both, and not separate them, nor set them at 
 variance. 

 (2.) That, when they opposed what Christ said concerning the sufferings 
 of the Son of man, they took no notice of what he had said concerning 
 his glory and exaltation. They had heard out of the law that <I>Christ 
 abideth for ever;</I> and had they not heard our Lord Jesus say that he 
 should be glorified, that he should bring forth much fruit, and draw 
 all men to him? Had he not just now promised immortal honours to his 
 followers, which supposed his abiding for ever? But this they 
 overlooked. Thus unfair disputants oppose some parts of the opinion of 
 an adversary, to which, if they would but take it entire, they could 
 not but subscribe; and in the doctrine of Christ there are paradoxes, 
 which to men of corrupt minds are stones of stumbling--as Christ 
 <I>crucified,</I> and yet <I>glorified; lifted up from the earth,</I> 
 and yet <I>drawing all men to him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They asked hereupon, <I>Who is the Son of man?</I> This they asked, 
 not with a desire to be instructed, but tauntingly and insultingly, as 
 if now they had baffled him, and run him down. "Thou sayest, <I>The Son 
 of man must die;</I> we have proved the Messiah must not, and where is 
 then thy Messiahship? This Son of man, as thou callest thyself, cannot 
 be the Messiah, thou must therefore think of something else to pretend 
 to." Now that which prejudiced them against Christ was his meanness and 
 poverty; they would rather have no Christ than a suffering one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. What Christ said to this exception, or rather what he said <I>upon 
 it.</I> The objection was a perfect cavil; they might, if they pleased, 
 answer it themselves: man dies, and yet is immortal, and abideth for 
 ever, so the <I>Son of man.</I> Therefore, instead of answering these 
 fools according to their folly, he gives them a serious caution to take 
 heed of trifling away the day of their opportunities in such vain and 
 fruitless cavils as these 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>):

 "<I>Yet a little while,</I> and but a little while, <I>is the light 
 with you;</I> therefore be wise for yourselves, and <I>walk while you 
 have the light.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general, we may observe here, 

 (1.) The concern Christ has for the souls of men, and his desire of 
 their welfare. With what tenderness does he here admonish those to look 
 well to themselves who were contriving ill against him! Even when he 
 <I>endured the contradiction of sinners,</I> he sought their 
 conversion. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:10">Prov. xxix. 10</A>.

 (2.) The method he takes with these objectors, <I>with meekness
 instructing those that opposed themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:25">2 Tim. ii. 25</A>.

 Were but men's consciences awakened with a due concern about their 
 everlasting state, and did they consider how little time they have to 
 spend, and none to spare, they would not waste precious thoughts and 
 time in trifling cavils.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Particularly we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The advantage they enjoyed in having Christ and his gospel among
 them, with the shortness and uncertainty of their enjoyment of it: 
 <I>Yet a little while is the light with you.</I> Christ is this light; 
 and some of the ancients suggest that, in calling himself the light, he 
 gives a tacit answer to their objection. His dying upon the cross was 
 as consistent with his <I>abiding for ever</I> as the setting of the 
 sun every night is with his perpetuity. The duration of Christ's 
 kingdom is compared to that of the sun and moon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:17,89:36,37">Ps. lxxii. 17; lxxxix. 36, 37</A>.
 
 The ordinances of heaven are unchangeably fixed, and yet the sun and
 moon set and are eclipsed; so Christ the Sun of righteousness abides 
 for ever, and yet was eclipsed by his sufferings, and was but a little 
 while within our horizon. Now, 

 [1.] The Jews at this time had the <I>light with them;</I> they had 
 Christ's bodily presence, heard his preaching, saw his miracles. The 
 scripture is to us a light shining in a dark place. 

 [2.] It was to be but a little while with them; Christ would shortly 
 leave them, their visible church state would soon after be dissolved 
 and the kingdom of God taken from them, and blindness and hardness 
 would happen unto Israel. Note, It is good for us all to consider what 
 a little while we are to have the light with us. Time is short, and 
 perhaps opportunity not so long. The candlestick may be removed; at 
 least, we must be removed shortly. Yet a little while is the light of 
 life with us; yet a little while is the light of the gospel with us, 
 the day of grace, the means of grace, the Spirit of grace, yet a very 
 little while.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The warning given them to make the best of this privilege while 
 they enjoyed it, because of the danger they were in of losing it: 
 <I>Walk while you have the light;</I> as travellers who make the best 
 of their way forward, that they may not be benighted in their journey, 
 because travelling in the night is uncomfortable and unsafe. "Come," 
 say they, "let us mend our pace, and get forward, while we have 
 day-light." Thus wise should we be for our souls who are journeying 
 towards eternity. Note, 

 [1.] It is our business to walk, to press forward towards heaven, and 
 to get nearer to it by being made fitter for it. Our life is but a day, 
 and we have a day's journey to go. 

 [2.] The best time of walking is while we have the light. The day is 
 the proper season for work, as the night is for rest. The proper time 
 for getting grace is when we have the word of grace preached to us, and 
 the Spirit of grace striving with us, and therefore then is the time to 
 be busy. 

 [3.] We are highly concerned thus to improve our opportunities, for 
 fear lest our day be finished before we have finished our day's work 
 and our day's journey: "<I>Lest darkness come upon you,</I> lest you 
 lose your opportunities, and can neither recover them nor despatch the 
 business you have to do without them." Then <I>darkness</I> comes, that 
 is, such an utter incapacity to make sure the great salvation as 
 renders the state of the careless sinner quite deplorable; so that, if 
 his work be undone then, it is likely to be undone for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The sad condition of those who have sinned away the gospel, and 
 are come to the period of their day of grace. <I>They walk in 
 darkness,</I> and know neither <I>where</I> they go, nor <I>whither</I> 
 they go; neither the way they are walking in, nor the end they are 
 walking towards. He that is destitute of the light of the gospel, and 
 is not acquainted with its discoveries and directions, wanders 
 endlessly in mistakes and errors, and a thousand crooked paths, and is 
 not aware of it. Set aside the instructions of the Christian doctrine, 
 and we know little of the difference between good and evil. He is going 
 to destruction, and knows not his danger, for he is either sleeping or 
 dancing at the pit's brink.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The great duty and interest of every one of us inferred from all 
 this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>While you have light, believe in the light.</I> The Jews had now 
 Christ's presence with them, let them improve it; afterwards they had 
 the first offers of the gospel made to them by the apostles wherever 
 they came; now this is an admonition to them not to out-stand their 
 market, but to accept the offer when it was made to them: the same 
 Christ saith to all who enjoy the gospel. Note, 

 [1.] It is the duty of every one of us <I>to believe in the gospel 
 light,</I> to receive it as a divine light, to subscribe to the truths 
 it discovers, for it is a light to our eyes, and to follow its 
 guidance, for it is a light to our feet. Christ is the light, and we 
 must believe in him as he is revealed to us; as a true light that will 
 not deceive us, a sure light that will not misguide us. 

 [2.] We are concerned to do this while we have the light, to lay hold 
 on Christ while we have the gospel to show us the way to him and direct 
 us in that way. 

 [3.] Those that believe in the light <I>shall be the children of 
 light;</I> they shall be owned as <I>Christians,</I> who are called 
 <I>children of light</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:8,Eph+5:8">Luke xvi. 8; Eph. v. 8</A>)
 
 and of the day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:5">1 Thess. v. 5</A>.

 Those that have God for their Father are children of light, for God is 
 light; they are born from above, and heirs of heaven, and children of 
 light, for heaven is light.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Christ's retiring from them, hereupon: <I>These things spoke 
 Jesus,</I> and said no more at this time, but left this to their 
 consideration, <I>and departed, and did hide himself from them.</I> And 
 this he did, 

 1. For their conviction and awakening. If they will not regard what he
 hath said, he will have nothing more to say to them. They are joined
 to their infidelity, as Ephraim to idols; <I>let them alone.</I> Note, 
 Christ justly removes the means of grace from those that quarrel with 
 him, and <I>hides his face</I> from <I>a froward generation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:20">Deut. xxxii. 20</A>.

 2. For his own preservation. He hid himself from their rage and fury,
 retreating, it is probable, to Bethany, where he lodged. By this it 
 appears that what he said irritated and exasperated them, and they were 
 made worse by that which should have made them better.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>37  But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet
 they believed not on him:
 &nbsp; 38  That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled,
 which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom
 hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
 &nbsp; 39  Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said
 again,
 &nbsp; 40  He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that
 they should not see with <I>their</I> eyes, nor understand with
 <I>their</I> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
 &nbsp; 41  These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake
 of him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the honour done to our Lord Jesus by the Old-Testament 
 prophets, who foretold and lamented the infidelity of the many that 
 believed not on him. It was indeed a dishonour and grief to Christ that 
 his doctrine met with so little acceptance and so much opposition; but 
 <I>this</I> takes off the wonder and reproach, makes the offence of it 
 to cease, and made it no disappointment to Christ, that herein the 
 scriptures were fulfilled. Two things are here said concerning this 
 untractable people, and both were foretold by the evangelical prophet 
 Isaiah, that they <I>did not</I> believe, and that they <I>could 
 not</I> believe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They did not believe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>Though he had done so many miracles before them,</I> which, one 
 would think, should have convinced them, yet they believed not, but 
 opposed him. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The abundance of the means of conviction which Christ afforded them: 
 He <I>did miracles, so many miracles;</I> <B><I>tosauta semeia</I></B> 
 signifying both so many and so great. This refers to all the miracles 
 he had wrought formerly; nay, the blind and lame now came to him into 
 the temple, and he healed them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:14">Matt. xxi. 14</A>.

 His miracles were the great proof of his mission, and on the evidence 
 of them he relied. Two things concerning them he here insists upon:--

 (1.) The number of them; they were <I>many,</I>--various and of divers
 kinds; numerous and often repeated; and every new miracle confirmed the 
 reality of all that went before. The multitude of his miracles was not 
 only a proof of his unexhausted power, but gave the greater opportunity 
 to examine them; and, if there had been a cheat in them, it was morally 
 impossible but that in some or other of them it would have been 
 discovered; and, being all <I>miracles of mercy,</I> the more there 
 were the more good was done. 

 (2.) The notoriety of them. He wrought these miracles <I>before 
 them,</I> not at a distance, not in a corner, but before many 
 witnesses, appearing to their own eyes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The inefficacy of these means: <I>Yet they believed not on him.</I> 
 They could not gainsay the premises, and yet would not grant the 
 conclusion. Note, The most plentiful and powerful means of conviction 
 will not of themselves work faith in the depraved prejudiced hearts of 
 men. These <I>saw,</I> and yet <I>believed not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The fulfilling of the scripture in this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>That the saying of Esaias might be fulfilled.</I> Not that these 
 infidel Jews designed the fulfilling of the scripture (they rather 
 fancied those scriptures which speak of the church's best sons to be 
 fulfilled in themselves), but the event exactly answered the 
 prediction, <I>so that (ut for ita ut</I>) this saying of Esaias was 
 fulfilled. The more improbable any event is, the more does a divine 
 foresight appear in the prediction of it. One could not have imagined 
 that the kingdom of the Messiah, supported with such pregnant proofs, 
 should have met with so much opposition among the Jews, and therefore 
 their unbelief is called a <I>marvellous work, and a wonder,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:14">Isa. xxix. 14</A>.

 Christ himself <I>marvelled at it,</I> but it was what Isaiah foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1">Isa. liii. 1</A>),

 and now it is accomplished. Observe, 

 (1.) The gospel is here called <I>their report: Who has believed,</I> 
 <B><I>te akon hemon</I></B>--<I>our hearing,</I> which we have heard 
 from God, and which you have heard from us. Our report is the report 
 that we bring, like the report of a matter of fact, or the report of a 
 solemn resolution in the senate. 

 (2.) It is foretold that a few comparatively of those to whom this 
 report is brought will be persuaded to give credit to it. Many hear it, 
 but few heed it and embrace it: <I>Who hath believed it?</I> Here and 
 there one, but none to speak of; not the wise, not the noble; it is to 
 them but a report which wants confirmation.

 (3.) It is spoken of as a thing to be greatly lamented that so few 
 believe the report of the gospel. <I>Lord</I> is here prefixed from the 
 LXX., but is not in the Hebrew, and intimates a sorrowful account 
 brought to God by the messengers of the cold entertainment which they 
 and their report had; as <I>the servant came, and showed his lord all 
 these things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:21">Luke xiv. 21</A>.

 (4.) The reason why men believe not the report of the gospel is because
 <I>the arm of the Lord</I> is not <I>revealed</I> to them, that is, 
 because they do not acquaint themselves with, and submit themselves to, 
 the grace of God; they do not experimentally know the virtue and 
 fellowship of Christ's death and resurrection, in which the arm of the 
 Lord is revealed. They saw Christ's miracles, but did not see the 
 <I>arm of the Lord revealed in them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They could not believe, and <I>therefore</I> they could not 
 <I>because Esaias said, He hath blinded their eyes.</I> This is a hard 
 saying, who can explain it? We are sure that God is infinitely just and 
 merciful, and therefore we cannot think there is in any such an 
 impotency to good, resulting from the counsels of God, as lays them
 under a fatal necessity of being evil. God dams none by mere
 sovereignty; yet it is said, <I>They could not believe.</I> St. Austin,
 coming in course to the exposition of these words, expresses himself
 with a holy fear of entering upon an enquiry into this mystery.
 <I>Justa sunt judicia ejus, sed occulta--His judgments are just, but
 hidden.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They <I>could not</I> believe, that is, they <I>would not;</I> they
 were obstinately resolved in their infidelity; thus Chrysostom and
 Austin incline to understand it; and the former gives divers instances
 of scripture of the putting of an impotency to signify the invincible
 refusal of the will, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:4">Gen. xxxvii. 4</A>,

 <I>They could not speak peaceably to him.</I> And 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:7"><I>ch.</I> vii. 7</A>.

 This is a <I>moral</I> impotency, like that of one that is accustomed
 to do evil,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:23">Jer. xiii. 23</A>.

 But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They could not because Esaias had said, <I>He hath blinded their 
 eyes.</I> Here the difficulty increases; it is certain that God is not 
 the author of sin, and yet,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) There is a righteous hand of God sometimes to be acknowledged in 
 the blindness and obstinacy of those who persist in impenitency and 
 unbelief, by which they are justly punished for their former resistance 
 of the divine light and rebellion against the divine law. If God 
 withhold abused grace, and give men over to indulged lusts,--if he 
 permit the evil spirit to do his work on those that resisted the good 
 Spirit,--and if in his providence he lay stumbling-blocks in the way of 
 sinners, which confirm their prejudices, then he <I>blinds their 
 eyes,</I> and <I>hardens their hearts,</I> and these are spiritual 
 judgments, like the giving up of idolatrous Gentiles to <I>vile 
 affections,</I> and degenerate Christians to <I>strong delusions.</I> 
 Observe the method of conversion implied here, and the steps taken in 
 it. 

 [1.] Sinners are brought to <I>see with their eyes,</I> to discern the 
 reality of divine things and to have some knowledge of them. 

 [2.] To <I>understand with their heart,</I> to apply these things to 
 themselves; not only to assent and approve, but to consent and accept.
 
 [3.] To <I>be converted,</I> and effectually turned from sin to Christ, 
 from the world and the flesh to God, as their felicity and portion.
 
 [4.] Then God will <I>heal</I> them, will justify and sanctify them; 
 will <I>pardon</I> their sins, which are as bleeding wounds, and 
 mortify their corruptions, which are as lurking diseases. Now when God 
 denies his grace nothing of this is done; the alienation of the mind 
 from, and its aversion to, God and the divine life, grow into a rooted 
 and invincible antipathy, and so the case becomes desperate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Judicial blindness and hardness are in the word of God threatened 
 against those who wilfully persist in wickedness, and were particularly 
 foretold concerning the Jewish church and nation. Known unto God are 
 all his works, and all ours too. Christ knew before who would betray 
 him, and spoke of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:70"><I>ch.</I> vi. 70</A>.

 This is a confirmation of the truth of scripture prophecies, and thus
 even the unbelief of the Jews may help to strengthen our faith. It is
 also intended for caution to particular persons, to <I>beware lest that
 come upon them which was spoken of in the prophets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:40">Acts xiii. 40</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What God has foretold will certainly come to pass, and so, by a 
 necessary consequence, in order of arguing, it might be said that 
 <I>therefore</I> they <I>could not believe,</I> because God by the 
 prophets had foretold they would not; for such is the knowledge of God 
 that he cannot be deceived in what he foresees, and such his truth that 
 he cannot deceive in what he foretels, so that the scripture cannot be 
 broken. Yet be it observed that the prophecy did not name particular 
 persons; so that it might not be said, "Therefore such a one and such a 
 one could not believe, because Esaias had said so and so;" but it 
 pointed at the body of the Jewish nation, which would persist in their 
 infidelity till their cities were wasted without inhabitants, as it 
 follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:11,12">Isa. vi. 11, 12</A>);
 
 yet still reserving a remnant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>,

 <I>in it shall be a tenth</I>), which reserve was sufficient to keep a 
 door of hope open to particular persons; for each one might say, Why 
 may not I be of that remnant?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The evangelist, having quoted the prophecy, shows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)

 that it was intended to look further than the prophet's own days, and 
 that its principal reference was to the days of the Messiah: <I>These
 things said Esaias when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.</I> 

 1. We read in the prophecy that this was said to Esaias, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:8,9">Isa. vi. 8, 9</A>.
 
 But here we are told that it was said <I>by him</I> to the purpose. For 
 nothing was said by him as a prophet which was not first said to him; 
 nor was any thing said to him which was not afterwards said by him to 
 those to whom he was sent. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:10">Isa. xxi. 10</A>.

 2. The vision which the prophet there had of the <I>glory of God</I> is
 here said to be his <I>seeing the glory</I> of Jesus Christ: He <I>saw 
 his glory.</I> Jesus Christ therefore is equal in power and glory with 
 the Father, and his praises are equally celebrated. Christ had a glory 
 <I>before the foundation of the world,</I> and Esaias saw this.

 3. It is said that the prophet there <I>spoke of him.</I> It seems to
 have been spoken of the prophet himself (for to him the commission and 
 instructions were there given), and yet it is here said to be spoken of 
 Christ, for as all the prophets testified of him so they all typified 
 him. This they spoke of him, that as to many his coming would be not 
 only fruitless, but fatal, a savour of death unto death. It might be 
 objected against his doctrine, If it was from heaven, why did not the 
 Jews believe it? But this is an answer to it; it was not for want of
 evidence, but because their <I>heart was made fat,</I> and their 
 <I>ears were heavy.</I> It was spoken of Christ, that he should be 
 glorified in the ruin of an unbelieving multitude, as well as in the 
 salvation of a distinguished remnant.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>42  Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on
 him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <I>him,</I>
 lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
 &nbsp; 43  For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of
 God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some honour was done to Christ by these rulers: for they <I>believed on
 him,</I> were convinced that he was sent of God, and received his
 doctrine as divine; but they did not do him honour enough, for they had
 not courage to own their faith in him. Many professed more kindness
 for Christ than really they had; these had more kindness for him than
 they were willing to profess. See here what a struggle was in these
 rulers between their convictions and their corruptions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See the power of the word in the convictions that many of them were 
 under, who did not wilfully shut their eyes against the light. They 
 <I>believed on him</I> as Nicodemus, received him as a teacher come 
 from God. Note, The truth of the gospel has perhaps a better interest 
 in the consciences of men than we are aware of. Many cannot but approve 
 of that in their hearts which yet outwardly they are shy of. Perhaps 
 these chief rulers were <I>true</I> believers, though very weak, and 
 their faith like smoking flax. Note, It may be, there are more good 
 people than we think there are. Elijah thought he was left alone, when 
 God had seven thousand faithful worshippers in Israel. Some are really 
 better than they seem to be. Their faults are known, but their 
 repentance is not; a man's goodness may be concealed by a 
 <I>culpable</I> yet pardonable weakness, which he himself truly repents 
 of. The <I>kingdom of God comes not</I> in all <I>with</I> a like 
 <I>observation;</I> nor have all who are good the same faculty of 
 appearing to be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See the power of the world in the smothering of these convictions. 
 They believed in Christ, but because of the Pharisees, who had it in 
 their power to do them a diskindness, they durst not confess him for 
 fear of being excommunicated. Observe here, 

 1. Wherein they failed and were defective; They did not <I>confess</I>
 Christ. Note, There is cause to question the sincerity of that faith
 which is either afraid or ashamed to show itself; for those who believe
 with the heart ought to <I>confess with the mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:9">Rom. x. 9</A>.

 2. What they feared: being <I>put out of the synagogue,</I> which they
 thought would be a disgrace and damage to them; as if it would do them 
 any harm to be expelled from a synagogue that had made itself a 
 synagogue of Satan, and from which God was departing. 

 3. What was at the bottom of this fear: <I>They loved the praise of
 men,</I> chose it as a more valuable good, and pursued it as a more 
 desirable end, than the <I>praise of God;</I> which was an implicit 
 idolatry, like that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:25">Rom. i. 25</A>)

 of <I>worshipping and serving the creature more than the Creator.</I> 
 They set these two in the scale one against the other, and, having 
 weighed them, they proceeded accordingly. 

 (1.) They set the praise of men in one scale, and considered how good 
 it was to give praise to men, and to pay a deference to the opinion of 
 the Pharisees, and receive praise from men, to be commended by the 
 chief priests and applauded by the people as good sons of the church, 
 the Jewish church; and they would not confess Christ, lest they should 
 thereby derogate from the reputation of the Pharisees, and forfeit 
 their own, and thus hinder their own preferment. And, besides, the
 followers of Christ were put into an <I>ill name,</I> and were looked 
 upon with contempt, which those who had been used to honour could not 
 bear. Yet perhaps if they had known one another's minds they would have 
 had more courage; but each one thought that if he should declare 
 himself in favour of Christ he should stand alone, and have nobody to 
 back him; whereas, if any one had had resolution to <I>break the 
 ice,</I> he would have had more <I>seconds</I> than he thought of. 

 (2.) They put the praise of God in the other scale. They were sensible 
 that by confessing Christ they should both give praise to God, and have 
 praise from God, that he would be pleased with them, and say, <I>Well 
 done;</I> but, 

 (3.) They gave the preference to the praise of men, and this turned the 
 scale; sense prevailed above faith, and represented it as more 
 desirable to stand right in the opinion of the Pharisees than to be 
 accepted of God. Note, Love of the praise of men is a very great 
 prejudice to the power and practice of religion and godliness. Many 
 come short of the glory of God by having a regard to the applause of 
 men, and a value for that. Love of the praise of men, as a by-end in 
 that which is good, will make a man a hypocrite when religion is in 
 fashion and credit is to be got by it; and love of the praise of men, 
 as a base principle in that which is evil, will make a man an apostate 
 when religion is in disgrace, and credit is to be lost for it, as here.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>44  Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not
 on me, but on him that sent me.
 &nbsp; 45  And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
 &nbsp; 46  I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth
 on me should not abide in darkness.
 &nbsp; 47  And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him
 not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
 &nbsp; 48  He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one
 that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall
 judge him in the last day.
 &nbsp; 49  For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent
 me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I
 should speak.
 &nbsp; 50  And I know that his commandment is life everlasting:
 whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so
 I speak.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the honour Christ not assumed, but asserted, to himself,
 in the account he gave of his mission and his errand into the world.
 Probably this discourse was not at the same time with that before

 (for them <I>he departed,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 but some time after, when he made another public appearance; and, as 
 this evangelist records it, it was Christ's farewell sermon to the 
 Jews, and his last public discourse; all that follows was private with 
 his disciples. Now observe how our Lord Jesus delivered this parting 
 word: he <I>cried and said. Doth not wisdom cry</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:1">Prov. viii. 1</A>),

 cry <I>without?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:20">Prov. i. 20</A>.

 The raising of his voice and crying intimate,

 1. His boldness in speaking. Though they had not courage openly to 
 profess faith in his doctrine, he had courage openly to publish it; if 
 they were ashamed of it, he was not, but set his face as a flint, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7">Isa. l. 7</A>.

 2. His earnestness in speaking. He cried as one that was serious and
 importunate, and in good earnest in what he said, and was willing to
 impart to them, not only the gospel of God, but <I>even his own
 soul.</I> 

 3. It denotes his desire that all might take notice of it. This being
 the last time of the publication of his gospel by himself in person, he 
 makes proclamation, "Whoever will hear me, let them come now." Now what 
 is the conclusion of the whole matter, this closing summary of all 
 Christ's discourses? It is much like that of Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:15">Deut. xxx. 15</A>):

 <I>See, I have set before you life and death.</I> So Christ here takes
 leave of the temple, with a solemn declaration of three things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The privileges and dignities of those that believe; this gives great 
 encouragement to us to believe in Christ and to profess that faith. It 
 is a thing of such a nature that we need not be shy either of doing it 
 or of owning it; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By believing in Christ we are brought into an <I>honourable 
 acquaintance with God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:44,45"><I>v.</I> 44, 45</A>):

 <I>He that believes on me,</I> and so <I>sees me, believes on him that 
 sent me,</I> and so <I>sees him.</I> He that believes on Christ, 

 (1.) He does not believe in a mere man, such a one as he seemed to be, 
 and was generally taken to be, but he believes in one that is the Son 
 of God and equal in power and glory with the Father. Or rather, 

 (2.) His faith does not terminate in Christ, but through him it is 
 carried out to the Father, that sent him, to whom, as our end, we come 
 by Christ as our way. The doctrine of Christ is believed and received 
 as the truth of God. The rest of a believing soul is in God through 
 Christ as Mediator; for its resignation to Christ is in order to being 
 presented to God. Christianity is made up, not of philosophy nor
 politics, but pure divinity. This is illustrated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 He that <I>sees me</I> (which is the same with <I>believing</I> in him, 
 for faith is the eye of the soul) <I>sees him that sent me;</I> in 
 getting an acquaintance with Christ, we come to the knowledge of God. 
 For,

 [1.] God makes himself known in the face of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:6">2 Cor. iv. 6</A>),

 who is the express image of his person, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb. i. 3</A>.

 [2.] All that have a believing sight of Christ are led by him to the 
 knowledge of God, whom Christ has revealed to us by his word and 
 Spirit. Christ, as God, was the image of his Father's person; but 
 Christ, as Mediator, was his Father's representative in his relation to 
 man, the divine light, law, and love, being communicated to us in and 
 through him; so that in seeing him (that is, in eying him as our 
 Saviour, Prince, and Lord, in the right of redemption), we see and eye 
 the Father as our owner, ruler, and benefactor, in the right of 
 creation: for God is pleased to deal with fallen man by proxy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are hereby brought into a comfortable enjoyment of ourselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 <I>I am come a light into the world, that whoever believes in me,</I> 
 Jew or Gentile, <I>should not abide in darkness.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) The character of Christ: <I>I am come a light into the world,</I> 
 to be a light to it. This implies that he had a being, and a being as 
 light, before he came into the world, as the sun is before it rises; 
 the prophets and apostles were made lights to the world, but it was 
 Christ only that came a light into this world, having before been a 
 glorious light in the upper world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:19"><I>ch.</I> iii. 19</A>.

 (2.) The comfort of Christians: They <I>do not abide in darkness.</I>
 
 [1.] They do not continue in that dark condition in which they were by 
 nature; they are <I>light in the Lord.</I> They are without any true 
 comfort, or joy, or hope, but do not continue in that condition; light 
 is sown for them.

 [2.] Whatever darkness of affliction, disquietment, or fear, they may 
 afterwards be in, provision is made that they may not long abide in it.
 
 [3.] They are delivered from that darkness which is perpetual, and 
 which <I>abideth for ever,</I> that utter darkness where there is not 
 the least gleam of light nor hope of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The peril and danger of those that believe not, which gives fair 
 warning to take heed of persisting in unbelief 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:47,48"><I>v.</I> 47, 48</A>):

 "<I>If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not,</I> not 
 I only, or not now, lest I should be looked upon as unfair in being 
 judge in my own cause; yet let not infidelity think therefore to go 
 unpunished, <I>though I judge him not, there is one that judgeth 
 him.</I>" So that we have here the doom of unbelief. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who they are whose unbelief is here condemned: those who <I>hear 
 Christ's words</I> and yet <I>believe them not.</I> Those shall not be 
 condemned for their infidelity that never had, nor could have, the 
 gospel; every man shall be judged according to the dispensation of 
 light he was under: <I>Those that have sinned without law shall be 
 judged without law.</I> But those that have heard, or might have heard, 
 and would not, lie open to this doom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What is the constructive malignity of their unbelief: not receiving 
 Christ's word; it is interpreted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>)

 a <I>rejecting</I> of Christ, <B><I>ho atheton eme</I></B>. It denotes 
 a rejection with scorn and contempt. Where the banner of the gospel is
 displayed, no neutrality is admitted; every man is either a subject or 
 an enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The wonderful patience and forbearance of our Lord Jesus, exercised 
 towards those who slighted him when he was come here upon earth: <I>I 
 judge him not,</I> not now. Note, Christ was not quick or hasty to take 
 advantage against those who refused the first offers of his grace, but 
 continued waiting to be gracious. He did not strike those dumb or dead 
 who contradicted him, never made intercession against Israel, as Elias 
 did; though he had authority to judge, he suspended the execution of 
 it, because he had work of another nature to do first, and that was to 
 <I>save the world.</I> 

 (1.) To save effectually those that were given him before he came to 
 judge the degenerate body of mankind. 

 (2.) To offer salvation to all the world, and thus far to save them 
 that it is their own fault if they be not saved. He was to put away sin 
 by the sacrifice of himself. Now the executing of the power of a judge 
 was not congruous with that undertaking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:33">Acts viii. 33</A>.

 <I>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away,</I> it was suspended
 for a time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The certain and unavoidable judgment of unbelievers at the great 
 day, the day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God: 
 unbelief will certainly be a damning sin. Some think when Christ saith, 
 <I>I judge no man,</I> he means that they are <I>condemned already.</I> 
 There needs no process, they are <I>self-judged;</I> no execution, they 
 are <I>self-ruined;</I> judgment goes against them of course, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:3">Heb. ii. 3</A>.
 
 Christ needs not appear against them as their accuser, they are
 miserable if he do not appear for them as their advocate; however, he 
 tells them plainly when and where they will be reckoned with. 

 (1.) There is <I>one that judgeth them.</I> Nothing is more dreadful 
 than abused patience, and grace trampled on; though for awhile <I>mercy 
 rejoiceth against judgment,</I> yet there will be <I>judgment without 
 mercy.</I> 

 (2.) Their final judgment is reserved to the <I>last day;</I> to that 
 day of judgment Christ here binds over all unbelievers, to answer then 
 for all the contempts they have put upon him. Divine justice has 
 <I>appointed a day,</I> and adjourns the sentence to that day, as 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:64">Matt. xxvi. 64</A>.

 (3.) The word of Christ will judge them then: <I>The words that I have
 spoken,</I> how light soever you have made of them, <I>the same shall 
 judge</I> the unbeliever <I>in the last day;</I> as the apostles, the 
 preachers of Christ's word, are said to judge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:30">Luke xxii. 30</A>.

 Christ's words will judge unbelievers two ways:--

 [1.] As the evidence of their crime, they will convict them. Every
 word Christ spoke, every sermon, every argument, every kind offer, will 
 be produced as a testimony against those who slighted all he said. 

 [2.] As the rule of their doom, they will condemn them; they shall be 
 judged according to the tenour of that covenant which Christ procured 
 and published. That word of Christ, <I>He that believes not shall be 
 damned,</I> will judge all unbelievers to eternal ruin; and there are 
 <I>many such like words.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A solemn declaration of the authority Christ had to demand our 
 faith, and require us to receive his doctrine upon pain of damnation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:49,50"><I>v.</I> 49, 50</A>,
 
 where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The commission which our Lord Jesus received from the Father to 
 deliver his doctrine to the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):

 <I>I have not spoken myself,</I> as a mere man, much less as a common 
 man; <I>but the Father gave me a commandment what I should say.</I> 
 This is the same with what he said

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:16"><I>ch.</I> vii. 16</A>.

 <I>My doctrine is,</I> 

 (1.) <I>Not mine,</I> for <I>I have not spoken of myself.</I> Christ, 
 as <I>Son of man,</I> did not speak that which was of human contrivance 
 or composure; as Son of God, he did not act separately, or by himself 
 alone, but what he said was the result of the counsels of peace; as 
 Mediator, his coming into the world was voluntary, and with his full 
 consent, but not arbitrary, and of his own head. But, 

 (2.) It was his that sent him. God the Father gave him, 

 [1.] His commission. God sent him as his agent and plenipotentiary, to 
 concert matters between him and man, to set a treaty of peace on foot, 
 and to settle the articles.

 [2.] His instructions, here called a <I>commandment,</I> for they were 
 like those given to an ambassador, directing him not only what he may 
 say, but what he must say. The messenger of the covenant was entrusted 
 with an errand which he must deliver. Note, Our Lord Jesus learned 
 obedience himself, before he taught it to us, though he was a Son.
 <I>The Lord God commanded</I> the first Adam, and he by his 
 disobedience ruined us; he commanded the second Adam, and he by his 
 obedience saved us. God commanded him what he should <I>say</I> and 
 what he should <I>speak,</I> two words signifying the same thing, to 
 denote that every word was divine. The Old-Testament prophets sometimes 
 spoke of themselves; but Christ spoke by the Spirit at all times. Some 
 make this distinction: He was directed what he should say in his set 
 sermons, and what he should speak in his familiar discourses. Others 
 this: He was directed what he should say in his preaching now, and what 
 he should speak in his judging at the last day; for he had commission 
 and instruction for both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The scope, design, and tendency of this commission: <I>I know that 
 his commandment is life everlasting,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.

 The commission given to Christ had a reference to the everlasting state 
 of the children of men, and was in order to their everlasting life and 
 happiness in that state: the instructions given to Christ as a prophet 
 were to reveal eternal life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:11">1 John v. 11</A>);

 the power, given to Christ as a king was to give eternal life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 2</A>.

 Thus the command given him was life everlasting. This Christ says he
 knew: "I know it is so," which intimates how cheerfully and with what 
 assurance Christ pursued his undertaking, knowing very well that he 
 went upon a good errand, and that which would bring forth fruit unto 
 life eternal. It intimates likewise how justly those will perish who 
 reject Christ and his word. Those who disobey Christ despise
 everlasting life, and renounce it; so that not only Christ's words will 
 judge them, but even their own; so shall their doom be, themselves have 
 decided it; and who can except against it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ's exact observance of the commission and instructions given 
 him, and his steady acting in pursuance of them: <I>Whatsoever I 
 speak,</I> it is <I>as the Father said unto me.</I> Christ was 
 intimately acquainted with the counsels of God, and was faithful in 
 discovering so much of them to the children of men as it was agreed 
 should be discovered, and <I>kept back nothing that was profitable.</I> 
 As the faithful witness delivers souls, so did he, and spoke the truth, 
 the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Note, 

 (1.) This is a great encouragement to faith; the sayings of Christ, 
 rightly understood, are what we may venture our souls upon. 

 (2.) It is a great example of obedience. Christ said as he was bidden, 
 and so must we, communicated what the Father had said to him, and so 
 must we. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:20">Acts iv. 20</A>.

 In the midst of all the respect paid to him, this is the honour he
 values himself upon, that what the Father had said to him that he 
 spoke, and in the manner as he was directed so he spoke. This was his 
 glory, that, as a Son, he was faithful to him that appointed him; and, 
 by an unfeigned belief of every word of Christ, and an entire 
 subjection of soul to it, we must give him the glory due to his 
 name.</P>
