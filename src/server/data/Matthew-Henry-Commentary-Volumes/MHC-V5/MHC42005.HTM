 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to
 hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,
 &nbsp; 2 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen
 were gone out of them, and were washing <I>their</I> nets.
 &nbsp; 3 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and
 prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And
 he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.
 &nbsp; 4 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out
 into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
 &nbsp; 5 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all
 the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I
 will let down the net.
 &nbsp; 6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude
 of fishes: and their net brake.
 &nbsp; 7 And they beckoned unto <I>their</I> partners, which were in the
 other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came,
 and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.
 &nbsp; 8 When Simon Peter saw <I>it,</I> he fell down at Jesus' knees,
 saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
 &nbsp; 9 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the
 draught of the fishes which they had taken:
 &nbsp; 10 And so <I>was</I> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee,
 which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear
 not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
 &nbsp; 11 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook
 all, and followed him.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This passage of story fell, in order of time, before the two miracles 
 we had in the close of the foregoing chapter, and is the same with that 
 which was more briefly related by Matthew and Mark, of Christ's calling 
 Peter and Andrew to be <I>fishers of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:18,Mk+1:16">Matt. iv. 18, and Mark i. 16</A>.
 
 They had not related this miraculous draught of fishes at that time,
 having only in view the calling of his disciples; but Luke gives us 
 that story as one of the many signs which Jesus did in the presence of 
 his disciples, which <I>had not been written</I> in the foregoing 
 books, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:30,31">John xx. 30, 31</A>.

 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What vast <I>crowds</I> attended Christ's preaching: <I>The people 
 pressed upon him to hear the word of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 insomuch that no house would contain them, but he was forced to draw
 them out to the <I>strand,</I> that they might be reminded of the 
 promise made to Abraham, that his seed should be <I>as the sand upon 
 the sea shore</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17">Gen. xxii. 17</A>),

 and yet of them but <I>a remnant shall be saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:27">Rom. ix. 27</A>.

 The people <I>flocked about him</I> (so the word signifies); they
 showed respect to his preaching, though not without some rudeness to 
 his person, which was very excusable, for they <I>pressed upon him.</I> 
 Some would reckon this a discredit to him, to be thus cried up by the 
 vulgar, when none of the <I>rulers</I> or of <I>the Pharisees believed 
 in him;</I> but he reckoned it an honour to him, for their souls were 
 as precious as the souls of the grandees, and it is his aim to bring 
 not so much the mighty as the <I>many sons</I> to God. It was foretold 
 concerning him that <I>to him shall the gathering of the people be.</I> 
 Christ was a popular preacher; and though he was able, at 
 <I>twelve,</I> to <I>dispute</I> with the <I>doctors,</I> yet he chose, 
 at <I>thirty,</I> to preach to the capacity of the <I>vulgar.</I> See 
 how the people relished <I>good preaching,</I> though under all 
 external disadvantages: they pressed to <I>hear the word of God;</I> 
 they could perceive it to be the <I>word of God,</I> by the divine 
 power and evidence that went along with it, and therefore they coveted 
 to hear it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What poor <I>conveniences</I> Christ had for preaching: <I>He stood 
 by the lake of Gennesareth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 upon a level with the crowd, so that they could neither see him nor 
 hear him; he was lost among them, and, every one striving to get near 
 him, he was crowded, and in danger of being crowded into the water: 
 what must he do? It does not appear that his hearers had any 
 contrivance to give him advantage, but <I>there were two ships,</I> or 
 <I>fishing boats,</I> brought ashore, one belonging to Simon and 
 Andrew, the other to Zebedee and <I>his sons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 At first, Christ saw Peter and Andrew fishing at some distance (so
 Matthew tells us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:18"><I>ch.</I> iv. 18</A>);

 but he waited till they came to land, and till the <I>fishermen,</I>
 that is, the servants, were <I>gone out of them</I> having washed their 
 nets, and thrown them by for that time: so Christ <I>entered</I> into 
 that <I>ship</I> that belonged to Simon, and begged of him that he 
 would lend it him for a pulpit; and, though he might have commanded 
 him, yet, for love's sake, he rather <I>prayed him</I> that he would 
 <I>thrust out a little from the land,</I> which would be the worse for 
 his being <I>heard,</I> but Christ would have it so, that he might the 
 better be <I>seen;</I> and it is his being <I>lifted up</I> that 
 <I>draws men to him.</I> Wisdom cries <I>in the top of high places,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:2">Prov. viii. 2</A>.

 It intimates that Christ had a strong voice (strong indeed, for he made 
 the <I>dead</I> to hear it), and that he did not desire to favour 
 himself. There he <I>sat down,</I> and <I>taught the people</I> the 
 good knowledge of the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What a particular acquaintance Christ, hereupon, fell into with 
 these fishermen. They had had some conversation with him before, which 
 began at John's baptism 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:40,41">John i. 40, 41</A>);

 they were with him at <I>Cana of Galilee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:2">John ii. 2</A>),
 
 and in Judea
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:3">John iv. 3</A>);

 but as yet they were not called to attend him constantly, and therefore 
 here we have them at their calling, and now it was that they were 
 called into a more intimate fellowship with Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When Christ had done preaching, he ordered Peter to apply himself to 
 the business of his calling again: <I>Launch out into the deep, and let 
 down your nets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It was not the sabbath day, and therefore, as soon as the lecture was 
 over, he set them to work. Time spent on week-days in the public 
 exercises of religion may be but little hindrance to us <I>in time,</I> 
 and a great furtherance to us in <I>temper of mind,</I> in our worldly 
 business. With what cheerfulness may we go about the duties of our 
 calling when we have been <I>in the mount</I> with God, and from thence 
 fetch a double blessing into our worldly employments, and thus have 
 them sanctified to us by the word and prayer! It is our wisdom and duty 
 so to manage our religious exercises as that they may befriend our 
 worldly business, and so to manage our worldly business as that it may 
 be no enemy to our religious exercises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Peter having <I>attended</I> upon Christ in his <I>preaching,</I> 
 Christ will <I>accompany</I> him in his <I>fishing.</I> He staid with 
 Christ at the shore, and now Christ will <I>launch out</I> with him 
 <I>into the deep.</I> Note, Those that will be constant followers of 
 Christ shall have him a constant guide to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ ordered Peter and his ship's crew to <I>cast their nets into 
 the sea,</I> which they did, in obedience to him, though they had been 
 hard at it all night, and had <I>caught nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 We may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How melancholy their business had now been: "<I>Master, we have 
 toiled all the night,</I> when we should have been asleep in our beds, 
 <I>and have taken nothing,</I> but have had our labour for our pains." 
 One would have thought that this should have excused them from hearing 
 the sermon; but such a love had they to the word of God that it was 
 more refreshing and reviving to them, after a wearisome night, than the 
 softest slumbers. But they mention it to Christ, when he bids them go a 
 fishing again. Note, 

 [1.] Some <I>callings</I> are much more <I>toilsome</I> than others 
 are, and more perilous; yet Providence has so ordered it for the common 
 good that there is no useful calling so discouraging but some or other 
 have a genius for it. Those who follow their business, and get 
 abundance by it with a great deal of ease, should think with compassion 
 of those who cannot follow theirs but with a great fatigue, and hardly 
 get a bare livelihood by it. When we have <I>rested all night,</I> let 
 us not forget those who have <I>toiled all night,</I> as Jacob, when he 
 kept Laban's sheep.

 [2.] Be the calling ever so laborious, it is good to see people 
 diligent in it, and make the best of it; these fishermen, that were 
 thus <I>industrious,</I> Christ singled out for his favourites. They 
 were fit to be preferred as good soldiers of Jesus Christ who had thus 
 learned to <I>endure hardness.</I>

 [3.] Even those who are most diligent in their business often meet with 
 disappointments; they who <I>toiled all night</I> yet <I>caught 
 nothing;</I> for the <I>race</I> is not always <I>to the swift.</I> God 
 will have us to be diligent, purely in duty to his command and 
 dependence upon his goodness, rather than with an assurance of worldly 
 success. We must do our duty, and then leave the event to God.

 [4.] When we are tired with our worldly business, and crossed in our 
 worldly affairs, we are welcome to come to Christ, and spread our case 
 before him, who will take cognizance of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How ready their obedience was to the command of Christ: 
 <I>Nevertheless, at thy word, I will let down the net.</I> 

 [1.] Though they had <I>toiled all night,</I> yet, if Christ bid them, 
 they will renew their toil, for they know that they who <I>wait on him 
 shall renew their strength,</I> as work is renewed upon their hands; 
 for every fresh service they shall have a fresh supply of <I>grace 
 sufficient.</I>

 [2.] Though they have <I>taken nothing,</I> yet, if Christ bid them 
 <I>let down for a draught,</I> they will hope to take <I>something.</I> 
 Note, We must not abruptly quit the callings wherein we are called 
 because we have not the success in them we promised ourselves. The 
 ministers of the gospel must continue to <I>let down</I> that 
 <I>net,</I> though they have perhaps <I>toiled long</I> and <I>caught 
 nothing;</I> and this is thank-worthy, to continue unwearied in our 
 labours, though we see not the success of them.

 [3.] In this they have an eye to the <I>word of Christ,</I> and a 
 dependence upon that: "<I>At thy word, I will let down the net,</I> 
 because thou dost enjoin it, and thou dost encourage it." We are 
 <I>then</I> likely to speed well when we follow the guidance of 
 Christ's word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The draught of fish they caught was so much beyond what was ever 
 known that it amounted to a miracle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 They <I>enclosed a great multitude of fishes,</I> so that <I>their net 
 broke,</I> and yet, which is strange, they did not lose their draught. 
 It was so great a <I>draught</I> that they had not hands sufficient to 
 draw it up; but they were obliged to beckon to their partners, who were 
 at a distance, out of call, to come and help them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 But the greatest evidence of the vastness of the draught was that they 
 filled both the ships with fish, to such a degree that they overloaded 
 them, and they <I>began to sink,</I> so that the fish had like to have 
 been lost again with their own weight. Thus many an overgrown estate, 
 raised out of the water, returns to the place whence it came. Suppose 
 these ships were but five or six tons a piece, what a vast quantity of 
 fish must there be to <I>load,</I> nay to <I>over-load,</I> them 
 both!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now by this vast draught of fishes, 

 (1.) Christ intended to show his <I>dominion</I> in the <I>seas</I> as 
 well as on the <I>dry land,</I> over its <I>wealth</I> as over its 
 <I>waves.</I> Thus he would show that he was that <I>Son of man</I> 
 under whose feet all things were put, and particularly the <I>fish of 
 the sea</I> and <I>whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:8">Ps. viii. 8</A>.

 (2.) He intended hereby to confirm the doctrine he had just now
 preached out of Peter's ship. We may suppose that the people on shore, 
 who heard the sermon, having a notion that the preacher was a prophet 
 sent of God, carefully attended his motions afterward, and staid 
 halting about there, to see what he would do next; and this miracle 
 immediately following would be a confirmation to their faith, of his 
 being at least <I>a teacher come from God.</I> 

 (3.) He intended hereby to repay Peter for the loan of his boat; for 
 Christ's gospel now, as his ark formerly in the house of Obed-edom, 
 will be sure to make amends, rich amends, for its kind entertainment. 
 None shall <I>shut a door or kindle a fire</I> in God's house <I>for 
 nought,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:10">Mal. i. 10</A>.

 Christ's recompences for services done to his name are abundant, they 
 are superabundant.

 (4.) He intended hereby to give a specimen, to those who were to be his
 ambassadors to the world, of the success of their embassy, that though 
 they might for a time, and in one particular place, <I>toil</I> and 
 <I>catch nothing,</I> yet they should be instrumental to bring in many 
 to Christ, and enclose many in the gospel net.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The impression which this miraculous draught of fishes made upon 
 Peter was very remarkable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) All <I>concerned</I> were <I>astonished,</I> and the more 
 <I>astonished</I> for their being <I>concerned.</I> All the boat's crew 
 were <I>astonished at the draught of fishes which they had taken</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 they were all surprised; and the more they considered it, and all the 
 circumstances of it, the more they were <I>wonder-struck,</I> I had 
 almost said <I>thunder-struck,</I> at the thought of it, <I>and so were 
 also James and John, who were partners with Simon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and who, for aught that appears, were not so well acquainted with 
 Christ, before this, as Peter and Andrew were. Now they were the more 
 <I>affected</I> with it, 

 [1.] Because they <I>understood</I> it better than others did. They
 that were well acquainted with this sea, and it is probable had plied 
 upon it many years, had never seen such a draught of fishes fetched out 
 of it, nor any thing like it, any thing near it; and therefore they 
 could not be tempted to diminish it, as others might, by suggesting 
 that it was accidental at this <I>time,</I> and what might as well have 
 happened at <I>any time.</I> It greatly corroborates the evidence of 
 Christ's miracles that those who were best <I>acquainted</I> with them 
 most <I>admired</I> them.

 [2.] Because they were most <I>interested</I> in it, and 
 <I>benefited</I> by it. Peter and his part-owners were gainers by this 
 great draught of fishes; it was a rich booty for them and therefore it 
 transported them, and their <I>joy</I> was a <I>helper</I> to their 
 <I>faith.</I> Note, When Christ's works of wonder are to us, in 
 particular, works of grace, then especially they command our faith in 
 his doctrine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Peter, above all the rest, was astonished to such a degree that he 
 <I>fell down at Jesus's knees,</I> as he sat in the stern of his boat, 
 and said, as one in an ecstasy or transport, that knew not where he was 
 or what he said, <I>Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Not that he feared the weight of the fish would sink him because he was 
 a sinful man, but that he thought himself unworthy of the favour of 
 Christ's presence in his boat, and worthy that it should be to him a 
 matter rather of terror than of comfort. This word of Peter's came from 
 the same principle with theirs who, under the Old-Testament, so often 
 said that they did <I>exceedingly fear and quake</I> at the 
 extraordinary display of the divine glory and majesty. It was the 
 language of Peter's humility and self-denial, and had not the least 
 tincture of the devils' dialect, <I>What have we to do with thee, 
 Jesus, thou Son of God?</I>

 [1.] His acknowledgment was very just, and what it becomes us all to 
 make: <I>I am a sinful man, O Lord.</I> Note, Even the <I>best men</I> 
 are <I>sinful men,</I> and should be ready upon all occasions to own 
 it, and especially to own it to Jesus Christ; for to whom else, but to 
 him who came into the world to <I>save sinners,</I> should <I>sinful 
 men</I> apply themselves?

 [2.] His inference from it was what <I>might have been</I> just, though 
 really it was not so. If I be a <I>sinful man,</I> as indeed I am, I 
 ought to say, "<I>Come to me, O Lord,</I> or let me come to thee, or I 
 am undone, <I>for ever undone.</I>" But, considering what reason 
 <I>sinful men</I> have to tremble before the holy Lord God and to dread 
 his wrath, Peter may well be excused, if, in a sense of his own 
 sinfulness and vileness, he cried out on a sudden, <I>Depart from 
 me.</I> Note, Those whom Christ designs to admit to the most 
 <I>intimate acquaintance</I> with him he first makes sensible that they 
 deserve to be set at the <I>greatest distance</I> from him. We must all 
 own ourselves <I>sinful men,</I> and that therefore Jesus Christ might 
 justly <I>depart from us;</I> but we must <I>therefore fall down at his 
 knees,</I> to pray him that he would not depart; for <I>woe unto us</I> 
 if he <I>leave us,</I> if the Saviour depart from the sinful man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The occasion which Christ took from this to intimate to Peter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and soon after to James and John 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:21">Matt. iv. 21</A>),

 his purpose to make them his apostles, and instruments of planting his 
 religion in the world. He <I>said unto Simon,</I> who was in the 
 greatest surprise of any of them at this prodigious draught of fishes, 
 "Thou shalt both see and do greater things than these; <I>fear not;</I> 
 let not this astonish thee; be not afraid that, after having done thee 
 this honour, it is so great that I shall never do thee more; no, 
 <I>henceforth thou shalt catch men,</I> by enclosing them in the gospel 
 net, and that shall be a greater instance of the Redeemer's power, and 
 his favour to thee, than this is; that shall be a more 
 <I>astonishing</I> miracle, and infinitely more <I>advantageous</I> 
 than this." When by Peter's preaching <I>three thousand souls</I> were, 
 <I>in one day,</I> added to the church, then the type of this great 
 draught of fishes was abundantly answered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The fishermen's farewell to their calling, in order to 
 their constant attendance on Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>When they had brought their ships to land,</I> instead of going to 
 seek for a market for their fish, that they might make the best hand 
 they could of this miracle, they <I>forsook all and followed him,</I> 
 being more solicitous to serve the interests of Christ than to advance 
 any secular interests of their own. It is observable that they <I>left 
 all to follow Christ,</I> when their calling prospered in their hands 
 more than ever it had done and they had had uncommon success in it. 
 When <I>riches increase,</I> and we are therefore most in temptation to 
 <I>set our hearts</I> upon them, then to quit them for the service of 
 Christ, this is <I>thank-worthy.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a
 man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on <I>his</I> face, and
 besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
 clean.
 &nbsp; 13 And he put forth <I>his</I> hand, and touched him, saying, I
 will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from
 him.
 &nbsp; 14 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show thyself
 to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses
 commanded, for a testimony unto them.
 &nbsp; 15 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and
 great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him
 of their infirmities.
 &nbsp; 16 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

 Here is, 

 I. The cleansing of a leper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.

 This narrative we had both in Matthew and Mark. It is here said to have 
 been <I>in a certain city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 it was in Capernaum, but the evangelist would not name it, perhaps
 because it was a reflection upon the government of the city that a 
 leper was suffered to be <I>in it.</I> This man is said to be <I>full 
 of leprosy;</I> he had that distemper in a high degree, which the more 
 fitly represents our natural pollution by sin; we are <I>full of that 
 leprosy, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot there is no 
 soundness in us.</I> Now let us learn here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What we must do in the sense of our spiritual leprosy. 

 (1.) We must <I>seek Jesus,</I> enquire after him, acquaint ourselves 
 with him, and reckon the discoveries made to us of Christ by the gospel 
 the most acceptable and welcome discoveries that could be made to us. 
 
 (2.) We must humble ourselves before him, as this leper, seeing Jesus, 
 <I>fell on his face.</I> We must be <I>ashamed</I> of our pollution, 
 and, in the sense of it, blush to lift up our faces before the <I>holy 
 Jesus.</I> 

 (3.) We must earnestly desire to be <I>cleansed</I> from the 
 defilement, and cured of the disease, of sin, which renders us unfit 
 for communion with God. 

 (4.) We must firmly believe Christ's ability and sufficiency to cleanse 
 us: Lord, <I>thou canst make me clean,</I> though I be <I>full of 
 leprosy.</I> No doubt is to be made of the merit and grace of Christ. 
 
 (5.) We must be importunate in prayer for pardoning mercy and renewing 
 grace: <I>He fell on his face and besought him;</I> they that would be 
 cleansed must reckon it a favour worth wrestling for. 

 (6.) We must refer ourselves to the good-will of Christ: <I>Lord, if 
 thou wilt, thou canst.</I> This is not so much the language of his 
 <I>diffidence,</I> or <I>distrust</I> of the good-will of Christ, as of 
 his submission and reference of himself and his case to the will, to 
 the good-will, of Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What we may expect from Christ, if we thus apply ourselves to him. 
 
 (1.) We shall find him very <I>condescending</I> and forward to take 
 cognizance of our case 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>He put forth his hand and touched him.</I> When Christ visited this 
 leprous world, unasked, unsought unto, he showed how low he could 
 stoop, to do good. His <I>touching</I> the leper was wonderful 
 condescension; but it is much greater to us when he is himself 
 <I>touched with the feeling of our infirmities.</I> 

 (2.) We shall find him very <I>compassionate,</I> and ready to relieve 
 us; he said, "<I>I will,</I> never doubt of that; whosoever comes to me 
 to be healed, <I>I will in no wise cast him out.</I>" He is as willing 
 to cleanse leprous souls as they can be to be cleansed. 

 (3.) We shall find him all-sufficient, and able to heal and cleanse us, 
 though we be ever so full of this loathsome leprosy. One word, one 
 touch, from Christ, did the business: <I>Immediately the leprosy 
 departed from him.</I> If Christ saith, "I will, be thou 
 <I>justified,</I> be thou <I>sanctified,</I>" it is done; for he has 
 power on earth to <I>forgive</I> sin, and power to give the Holy 
 Spirit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What he requires from those that are cleansed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Has Christ sent his word and healed us?

 (1.) We must be very <I>humble</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>He charged him to tell no man.</I> This, it should seem, did not 
 forbid him telling it to the honour of Christ, but he must not tell it 
 to his own honour. Those whom Christ hath healed and cleansed must know 
 that he hath done it in such a way as for ever excludes boasting.

 (2.) We must be very <I>thankful,</I> and make a grateful 
 acknowledgment of the divine grace: <I>Go, and offer for thy 
 cleansing.</I> Christ did not require him to give him a fee, but to 
 bring the sacrifice of praise to God; so far was he from using his 
 power to the prejudice of the law of Moses.

 (3.) We must <I>keep close to our duty;</I> go <I>to the priest,</I> 
 and those that attend him. The man whom Christ had made whole he
 <I>found in the temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:14">John v. 14</A>.

 Those who by any affliction have been detained from public ordinances
 should, when the affliction is removed, attend on them the more 
 diligently, and adhere to them the more constantly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ's <I>public serviceableness</I> to men and his <I>private 
 communion</I> with God; these are put together here, to give lustre to 
 each other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Though never any had so much <I>pleasure</I> in his 
 <I>retirements</I> as Christ had, yet he was <I>much in a crowd,</I> to 
 do good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Though the leper should altogether hold his peace, yet the thing could 
 not be hid,<I> so much the more went there a fame abroad of him.</I> 
 The more he sought to conceal himself under a veil of humility, the 
 more notice did people take of him; for honour is like a shadow, which 
 flees from those that pursue it (<I>for a man to seek his own glory is 
 not glory),</I> but follows those that decline it, and draw from it. 
 The less good men say of themselves, the more will others say of them. 
 But Christ reckoned it a small honour to him that his <I>fame went 
 abroad;</I> it was much more so that hereby multitudes were brought to 
 receive benefit by him.

 [1.] By his preaching. They came together to <I>hear</I> him, and to 
 receive instruction from him concerning the kingdom of God.

 [2.] By his miracles. They came <I>to be healed by him of their 
 infirmities;</I> that invited them to come to hear him, confirmed his 
 doctrine, and recommended it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Though never any did so much <I>good in public,</I> yet he found 
 time for <I>pious</I> and <I>devout retirements</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>He withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed;</I> not that he 
 needed to avoid either distraction or ostentation, but he would set us 
 an example, who need to order the circumstances of our devotion so as 
 to guard against both. It is likewise our wisdom so to order our 
 affairs as that our public work and our secret work may not intrench 
 upon, nor interfere with, one another. Note, Secret prayer must be 
 performed secretly; and those that have ever so much to do of the best 
 business in this world must keep up constant stated times for it.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching,
 that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by,
 which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Jud&aelig;a, and
 Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was <I>present</I> to heal them.
 &nbsp; 18 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with
 a palsy: and they sought <I>means</I> to bring him in, and to lay
 <I>him</I> before him.
 &nbsp; 19 And when they could not find by what <I>way</I> they might bring
 him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and
 let him down through the tiling with <I>his</I> couch into the midst
 before Jesus.
 &nbsp; 20 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins
 are forgiven thee.
 &nbsp; 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying,
 Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but
 God alone?
 &nbsp; 22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said
 unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?
 &nbsp; 23 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to
 say, Rise up and walk?
 &nbsp; 24 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon
 earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I
 say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine
 house.
 &nbsp; 25 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that
 whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
 &nbsp; 26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were
 filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 I. A general account of Christ's preaching and miracles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 1. He was <I>teaching on a certain day,</I> not on the sabbath day, 
 then he would have said so, but on a <I>week-day; six days shalt thou 
 labour,</I> not only for <I>the world,</I> but for <I>the soul,</I> and 
 the welfare of that. Preaching and hearing the word of <I>God</I> are 
 <I>good works,</I> if they be <I>done well,</I> any day in the 
 <I>week,</I> as well as on sabbath days. It was not in the 
 <I>synagogue,</I> but in a <I>private house;</I> for even there where 
 we ordinarily converse with our friends it is not improper to give and 
 receive good instruction. 

 2. There he <I>taught,</I> he <I>healed</I> (as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>And the power of the Lord was to heal them</I>--<B><I>en eis to
 iasthai autous</I></B>. It was <I>mighty</I> to heal them; it was
 <I>exerted</I> and <I>put forth</I> to heal them, to heal those whom he 
 <I>taught</I> (we may understand it so), to heal their souls, to cure 
 them of their spiritual diseases, and to give them a new life, a new 
 nature. Note, Those who receive the word of Christ in faith will find a 
 divine power going along with that word, to <I>heal them;</I> for 
 Christ came with his comforts to <I>heal the broken-hearted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:18"><I>ch.</I> iv. 18</A>.

 The power of the Lord is <I>present</I> with the word, <I>present to
 those</I> that pray for it and submit to it, <I>present to heal 
 them.</I> Or it may be meant (and so it is generally taken) of the 
 healing of those who were <I>diseased in body,</I> who came to him for 
 cures. Whenever there was occasion, Christ had not <I>to seek</I> for 
 his power, it was <I>present to heal.</I> 

 3. There were some grandees present in this assembly, and, as it should
 seem, more than usual: <I>There were Pharisees, and doctors of the law, 
 sitting by;</I> not sitting <I>at his feet,</I> to learn of him; then I 
 should have been willing to take the following clause as referring to 
 those who are spoken of immediately before (the <I>power of the Lord 
 was present to heal them</I>); and why might not the word of Christ 
 reach their hearts? But, by what follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 it appears that they were <I>not healed,</I> but cavilled at Christ, 
 which compels us to refer this to others, not to them; for they <I>sat 
 by</I> as <I>persons unconcerned,</I> as if the word of Christ were 
 nothing to them. They sat by as spectators, censors, and spies, to pick 
 up something on which to ground a reproach or accusation. How many are 
 there in the midst of our assemblies, where the gospel is preached, 
 that do not <I>sit under</I> the word, but <I>sit by!</I> It is to them 
 as a <I>tale</I> that is <I>told them,</I> not as a <I>message</I> that 
 is <I>sent them;</I> they are willing that we should preach <I>before 
 them,</I> not that we should preach <I>to them.</I> These Pharisees and 
 scribes (or doctors of the law) <I>came out of every town of Galilee, 
 and Judea, and Jerusalem;</I> they came from all parts of the nation.
 Probably, they appointed to meet at this time and place, to see what 
 remarks they could make upon Christ and what he said and did. They were 
 in a confederacy, as those that said, <I>Come, and let us devise 
 devices against Jeremiah,</I> and agree to <I>smite him with the 
 tongue,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:18">Jer. xviii. 18</A>.

 <I>Report, and we will report it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:10">Jer. xx. 10</A>.

 Observe, Christ went on with his work of <I>preaching</I> and
 <I>healing,</I> though he saw these Pharisees, and doctors of the 
 Jewish church, <I>sitting by,</I> who, he knew, <I>despised</I> him, 
 and watched to <I>ensnare him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular account of the cure of the man <I>sick of the 
 palsy,</I> which was related much as it is here by both the foregoing 
 evangelists: let us therefore only observe in short,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The doctrines that are taught us and confirmed to us by the story of 
 this cure. 

 (1.) That sin is the fountain of all sickness, and the forgiveness of 
 sin is the only foundation upon which a recovery from sickness can 
 comfortably be built. They presented the <I>sick man</I> to Christ, and 
 he said, "<I>Man, thy sins are forgiven thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 that is the blessing thou art most to prize and seek; for if thy sins 
 be forgiven thee, though the sickness be continued, it is in mercy; if 
 they be not, though the sickness be removed, it is in wrath." The cords 
 of our iniquity are the bands of our affliction. 

 (2.) That Jesus Christ has power on earth to <I>forgive sins,</I> and 
 his healing diseases was an <I>incontestable</I> proof of it. This was 
 the thing intended to be proved 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>That ye may know</I> and believe <I>that the Son of man,</I> though 
 now upon earth in his state of humiliation, <I>hath power to forgive 
 sins,</I> and to release sinners, upon gospel terms, from the eternal 
 punishment of sin, he <I>saith to the sick of the palsy, Arise, and 
 walk;</I> and he is cured immediately. Christ claims one of the 
 prerogatives of the King of kings when he undertakes to <I>forgive 
 sin,</I> and it is justly expected that he should produce a good proof 
 of it. "Well," saith he, "I will put it upon this issue: here is a man 
 struck with a palsy, and <I>for his sin;</I> if I do not with a word's 
 speaking cure his disease in an instant, which cannot be done by nature 
 or art, but purely by the immediate power and efficacy of the God of 
 nature, then say that I am not entitled to the prerogative of forgiving 
 sin, am not the Messiah, am not the Son of God and King of Israel: but, 
 if I do, you must own that <I>I have power to forgive sins.</I>" Thus 
 it was put upon a fair trial, and one word of Christ determined it. He 
 did but say, <I>Arise, take up thy couch,</I> and that <I>chronical</I> 
 disease had an <I>instantaneous</I> cure; <I>immediately he arose 
 before them.</I> They must all own that there could be no cheat or 
 fallacy in it. They that brought him could attest how perfectly 
 <I>lame</I> he was before; they that saw him could attest how perfectly 
 <I>well</I> he was now, insomuch that he had strength enough to take up 
 and carry away the bed he lay upon. How well is it for us that this 
 most comfortable doctrine of the gospel, that <I>Jesus Christ,</I> our 
 <I>Redeemer and Saviour,</I> has <I>power to forgive sin,</I> has such 
 a full attestation! 

 (3.) That Jesus Christ is God. He appears to be so, 

 [1.] By <I>knowing the thoughts</I> of the scribes and Pharisees

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 which it is God's prerogative to do, though these scribes and Pharisees 
 knew as well how to conceal their thoughts, and keep their 
 countenances, as most men, and probably were industrious to do it at 
 this time, for they <I>lay in wait secretly.</I> 

 [2.] By doing that which their thoughts owned none could do but God 
 only

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Who can forgive sins,</I> say they, <I>but only God?</I> "I will 
 prove," saith Christ, "that I can forgive sins;" and what follows then 
 but that <I>he is God</I>? What horrid wickedness then were
 <I>they</I> guilty of who charged him with speaking the <I>worst</I> of 
 <I>blasphemies,</I> even when he spoke the <I>best</I> of <I>blessings, 
 Thy sins are forgiven thee!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The duties that are taught us, and recommended to us, by this story. 
 
 (1.) In our applications to Christ, we must be very <I>pressing</I> and 
 <I>urgent:</I> that is an evidence of faith, and is very pleasing to 
 Christ and prevailing with him. They that were the friends of this sick 
 man <I>sought means to bring him in before Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 and, when they were baffled in their endeavour, they did not give up 
 their cause; but when they could not get in by <I>the door,</I> it was 
 so crowded, they untiled the house, and let the poor patient down 
 through the roof, <I>into the midst before Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 In this Jesus Christ <I>saw their faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Now here he has taught us (and it were well if we could learn the 
 lesson) to <I>put the best construction</I> upon words and actions that 
 they <I>will bear.</I> When the centurion and the woman of Canaan were 
 in no care at all to bring the patients they interceded for into 
 Christ's presence, but believed that he could cure them <I>at a 
 distance,</I> he commended <I>their faith.</I> But though in 
 <I>these</I> there seemed to be a <I>different</I> notion of the thing, 
 and an apprehension that it was requisite the <I>patient</I> should be 
 <I>brought into his presence,</I> yet he did not <I>censure</I> and 
 <I>condemn</I> their weakness, did not ask them, "Why do you give this 
 disturbance to the assembly? Are you under such a degree of infidelity 
 as to think I could not have cured him, though he had been out of 
 doors?" But he made the best of it, and even in <I>this</I> he saw 
 <I>their faith.</I> It is a comfort to us that we serve a Master that 
 is willing to <I>make the best</I> of us.

 (2.) When we are sick, we should be more in care to get our sins 
 pardoned than to get our sickness removed. Christ, in what he said to 
 this man, taught us, when we seek to God for health, to begin with 
 seeking to him for pardon. 

 (3.) The mercies which we have the comfort of God must have the praise 
 of. The man <I>departed to his own house, glorifying God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 To him belong the escapes from death, and in them therefore he must be 
 <I>glorified.</I>

 (4.) The miracles which Christ wrought were <I>amazing</I> to those 
 that saw them, and we ought to <I>glorify</I> God in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 They said, "<I>We have seen strange things to-day,</I> such as we never 
 saw before, nor our fathers before us; they are altogether new." But 
 they <I>glorified</I> God, who had sent into their country such a 
 benefactor to it; and were <I>filled with fear,</I> with a reverence of 
 God, with a jealous persuasion that this was the Messiah and that he 
 was not treated by their nation as he ought to be, which might prove in 
 the end the ruin of their state; perhaps they were some such thoughts 
 as these that <I>filled them with fear,</I> and a concern likewise for 
 themselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican,
 named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto
 him, Follow me.
 &nbsp; 28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
 &nbsp; 29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there
 was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with
 them.
 &nbsp; 30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his
 disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and
 sinners?
 &nbsp; 31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need
 not a physician; but they that are sick.
 &nbsp; 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
 &nbsp; 33 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast
 often, and make prayers, and likewise <I>the disciples</I> of the
 Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?
 &nbsp; 34 And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the
 bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
 &nbsp; 35 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
 away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
 &nbsp; 36 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a
 piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the
 new maketh a rent, and the piece that was <I>taken</I> out of the new
 agreeth not with the old.
 &nbsp; 37 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new
 wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles
 shall perish.
 &nbsp; 38 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
 preserved.
 &nbsp; 39 No man also having drunk old <I>wine</I> straightway desireth
 new: for he saith, The old is better.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All this, except the last verse, we had before in Matthew and Mark; it 
 is not the story of any <I>miracle in nature</I> wrought by our Lord 
 Jesus, but it is an account of some of the <I>wonders of his grace,</I> 
 which, to those who understand things aright, are no less cogent proofs 
 of Christ's being sent of God than the other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It was a wonder of his grace that he would call a <I>publican,</I> 
 from the <I>receipt of custom,</I> to be his disciple and follower, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 It was wonderful condescension that he should admit poor fishermen to 
 that honour, men of the <I>lowest rank;</I> but much more wonderful 
 that he should admit <I>publicans,</I> men of the <I>worst 
 reputation,</I> men of <I>ill fame.</I> In this Christ <I>humbled 
 himself,</I> and appeared <I>in the likeness of sinful flesh.</I> By 
 this he <I>exposed himself,</I> and got the invidious character of a 
 <I>friend of publicans and sinners.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It was a wonder of his grace that the call was made 
 <I>effectual,</I> became immediately so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 This publican, though those of that employment commonly had little 
 inclination to religion, for his religion's sake left a good place in 
 the custom-house (which, probably, was his livelihood, and where he 
 stood fair for better preferment), and <I>rose up, and followed
 Christ.</I> There is no heart too hard for the Spirit and grace of 
 Christ to work upon, nor any difficulties in the way of a sinner's 
 conversion insuperable to his power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It was a wonder of his grace that he would not only admit a 
 converted publican into his family, but would keep company with 
 unconverted publicans, that he might have an opportunity of doing their 
 souls good; he justified himself in it, as agreeing with the great 
 design of his coming into the world. Here is a wonder of grace indeed, 
 that Christ undertakes to be the Physician of souls <I>distempered</I> 
 by sin, and ready to <I>die</I> of the distemper (he is a Healer by
 office, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)--

 that he has a particular regard to the sick, to sinners as his 
 patients, convinced awakened sinners, that see their need of the 
 Physician--that he came to call <I>sinners,</I> the worst of sinners, 
 to repentance, and to assure them of pardon, upon repentance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 These are glad tidings of great joy indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It was a wonder of his grace that he did so patiently bear the 
 <I>contradiction of sinners</I> against himself and his disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He did not express his resentment of the cavils of the scribes and 
 Pharisees, as he justly might have done, but answered them with reason 
 and meekness; and, instead of taking that occasion to show his 
 displeasure against the Pharisees, as afterwards he did, or of 
 recriminating upon them, he took that occasion to show his compassion 
 to poor publicans, another sort of sinners, and to encourage them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. It was a wonder of his grace that, in the discipline under which he 
 trained up his disciples, he <I>considered their frame,</I> and 
 proportioned their services to their strength and standing, and to the 
 circumstances they were in. It was objected, as a blemish upon his 
 conduct, that he did not make <I>his disciples</I> to <I>fast</I> so 
 often as those of the <I>Pharisees</I> and John Baptist did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 He insisted most upon that which is the <I>soul</I> of fasting, the 
 mortification of sin, the crucifying of the flesh, and the living of a 
 life of self-denial, which is as much better than fasting and corporal 
 penances as <I>mercy</I> is better than <I>sacrifice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. It was a wonder of his grace that Christ reserved the trials of his 
 disciples for their latter times, when by his grace they were in some 
 good measure better prepared and fitted for them than they were at 
 first. Now they were as the <I>children of the bride-chamber,</I> when 
 the <I>bridegroom is with them,</I> when they have plenty and joy, and 
 every day is a festival. Christ was welcomed wherever he came, and they 
 for his sake, and as yet they met with little or no opposition; but 
 this will not last always. <I>The days will come</I> when the 
 <I>bridegroom shall be taken away from them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 When Christ shall leave them with their hearts full of sorrow, their 
 hands full of work, and the world full of enmity and rage against them, 
 <I>then shall they fast,</I> shall not be so well fed as they are now. 
 <I>We both hunger and thirst and are naked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:11">1 Cor. iv. 11</A>.

 Then they shall keep many more <I>religious fasts</I> than they do now,
 for Providence will call them to it; they will then serve the Lord
 <I>with fastings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:2">Acts xiii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. It was a wonder of his grace that he proportioned their exercises 
 to their strength. He would not put <I>new cloth upon an old 
 garment</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 nor <I>new wine into old bottles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>);

 he would not, as soon as ever he had called them out of the world, put 
 them upon the strictnesses and austerities of discipleship, lest they 
 should be tempted to <I>fly off.</I> When God brought Israel out of 
 Egypt, he would not bring them <I>by the way of the Philistines,</I> 
 lest they should <I>repent,</I> when they <I>saw war,</I> and <I>return 
 to Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:17">Exod. xiii. 17</A>.

 So Christ would train up his followers gradually to the discipline of 
 his family; for no man, having <I>drank old wine,</I> will <I>of a 
 sudden,</I> straightway, <I>desire new,</I> or relish it, but will say, 
 <I>The old is better,</I> because he has been <I>used to it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 The disciples will be tempted to think their old way of living better,
 till they are by degrees trained up to this way whereunto they are 
 called. Or, turn it the other way: "Let them be <I>accustomed</I> 
 awhile to religious exercises, and then they will <I>abound</I> in them 
 as much as you do: but we must not be too hasty with them." Calvin 
 takes it as an admonition to the Pharisees not to boast of their 
 fasting, and the noise and show they made with it, nor to despise his 
 disciples because they did not in like manner <I>signalize</I> 
 themselves; for the profession the Pharisees made was indeed 
 <I>pompous</I> and <I>gay,</I> like <I>new wine</I> that is brisk and 
 sparkling, whereas all wise men say, <I>The old is better;</I> for, 
 though it does not give its colour so well in the cup, yet it is more 
 warming in the stomach and more wholesome. Christ's disciples, though 
 they had not so much of the <I>form of godliness,</I> had more of the 
 <I>power of it.</I></P>
