 This chapter is a prayer, it is the Lord's prayer, the Lord Christ's 
 prayer. There was one Lord's prayer which he taught us to pray, and did 
 not pray himself, for he needed not to pray for the forgiveness of sin; 
 but this was properly and peculiarly his, and suited him only as a 
 Mediator, and is a sample of his intercession, and yet is of use to us 
 both for instruction and encouragement in prayer. Observe,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven,
 and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son
 also may glorify thee:
 &nbsp; 2  As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should
 give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
 &nbsp; 3  And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
 true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
 &nbsp; 4  I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
 which thou gavest me to do.
 &nbsp; 5  And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with
 the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. The circumstances of this prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Many a solemn prayer Christ made in the days of his flesh (sometimes he 
 continued all night in prayer), but none of his prayers are recorded so 
 fully as this. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The time when he prayed this prayer; when he had <I>spoken these 
 words,</I> had given the foregoing farewell to his disciples, he prayed 
 this prayer in their hearing; so that, 

 (1.) It was a prayer after a sermon; when he had spoken from God to 
 them, he turned to speak to God for them. Note, Those we preach to we 
 must pray for. He that was to prophesy upon the dry bones was also to 
 pray, <I>Come, O breath, and breathe</I> upon them. And the word 
 preached should be prayed over, for God <I>gives the increase.</I> 

 (2.) It was a prayer after sacrament; after Christ and his disciples 
 had eaten the passover and the Lord's supper together, and he had given 
 them a suitable exhortation, he closed the solemnity with this prayer, 
 that God would preserve the good impressions of the ordinance upon 
 them. 

 (3.) It was a family-prayer. Christ's disciples were his family, and,
 to set a good example before the masters of families, he not only, as 
 the son of Abraham, taught his household 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19">Gen. xviii. 19</A>),

 but, as a son of David, blessed his household 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:20">2 Sam. vi. 20</A>),

 prayed for them and with them. 

 (4.) It was a parting prayer. When we and our friends are parting, it 
 is good to part with prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:36">Acts xx. 36</A>.

 Christ was parting by death, and that parting should be sanctified and 
 sweetened by prayer. Dying Jacob blessed the twelve patriarchs, dying 
 Moses the twelve tribes, and so, here, dying Jesus the twelve apostles.
 
 (5.) It was a prayer that was a preface to his sacrifice, which he was 
 now about to offer on earth, specifying the favours and blessings 
 designed to be purchased by the merit of his death for those that were 
 his; like a deed <I>leading the uses of a fine,</I> and directing to 
 what intents and purposes it shall be levied. Christ prayed then as a 
 priest now offering sacrifice, in the virtue of which all prayers were 
 to be made.

 (6.) It was a prayer that was a specimen of his intercession, which he 
 ever lives to make for us within the veil. Not that in his exalted 
 state he addresses himself to his Father by way of humble petition, as 
 when he was on earth. No, his intercession in heaven is a presenting of 
 his merit to his Father, with a suing out of the benefit of it for all 
 his chosen ones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The outward expression of fervent desire which he used in this 
 prayer: He <I>lifted up his eyes to heaven,</I> as before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:41"><I>ch.</I> xi. 41</A>);

 not that Christ needed thus to engage his own attention, but he was 
 pleased thus to sanctify this gesture to those that use it, and justify
 it against those that ridicule it. It is significant of the lifting up
 of the soul to God in prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:1">Ps. xxv. 1</A>.

 <I>Sursum corda</I> was anciently used as a call to prayer, <I>Up with 
 your hearts,</I> up to heaven; thither we must direct our desires in 
 prayer, and thence we must expect to receive the good things we pray 
 for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The first part of the prayer itself, in which Christ prays for 
 himself. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He prays to God as a Father: He <I>lifted up his eyes, and said, 
 Father.</I> Note, As prayer is to be made to God only, so it is our 
 duty in prayer to eye him as a Father, and to call him <I>our 
 Father.</I> All that have the Spirit of adoption are taught to cry 
 <I>Abba, Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 For it will be of great use to us in prayer, both for direction and for 
 encouragement, to call God as we hope to find him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He prayed for himself first. Though Christ, as God, was prayed to, 
 Christ, as man, prayed; thus <I>it became him to fulfill all 
 righteousness.</I> It was said to him, as it is said to us, <I>Ask, and 
 I will give thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8">Ps. ii. 8</A>.

 What he had purchased he must ask for; and shall we expect to have what
 we never merited, but have a thousand times forfeited, unless we pray 
 for it? This puts an honour upon prayer, that it was the messenger 
 Christ sent on his errands, the way in which even he corresponded with 
 Heaven. It likewise gives great encouragement to praying people, and 
 cause to hope that even the <I>prayer of the destitute</I> shall not be 
 despised; time was when he that is advocate for us had a cause of his 
 own to solicit, a great cause, on the success of which depended all his 
 honour as Mediator; and this he was to solicit in the same method that 
 is prescribed to us, <I>by prayers and supplications</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>),

 so that he knows the heart of a petitioner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:9">Exod. xxiii. 9</A>),

 he knows the way. Now observe, Christ began with prayer for himself, 
 and afterwards prayed for his disciples; this charity must begin at 
 home, though it must not end there. We must love and pray for our 
 neighbor as ourselves, and therefore must in a right manner love and 
 pray for ourselves first. Christ was much shorter in his prayer for 
 himself than in his prayer for his disciples. Our prayers for the 
 church must not be crowded into a corner of our prayers; in making 
 <I>supplication for all saints,</I> we have room enough to enlarge, and 
 should not straiten ourselves. Now here are two petitions which Christ 
 puts up for himself, and these two are one--that he might be glorified. 
 But this one petition, <I>Glorify thou me,</I> is twice put up, because 
 it has a double reference. To the prosecution of his undertaking 
 further: <I>Glorify me, that I may glorify thee,</I> in doing what is 
 agreed upon to be yet done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>.

 And to the performance of his undertaking hitherto: "<I>Glorify me, for 
 I have glorified thee.</I> I have done my part, and now, Lord, do 
 thine," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ here prays to be <I>glorified,</I> in order to his 
 <I>glorifying God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Glorify thy Son</I> according to thy promise, <I>that thy Son may 
 glorify thee</I> according to his understanding. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What he prays for--that he might be glorified in this world:
 "<I>The hour is come</I> when all the powers of darkness will combine 
 to vilify thy Son; now, Father, glorify him." The Father glorified the 
 <I>Son</I> upon earth, <I>First,</I> Even in his sufferings, by the 
 signs and wonders which attended them. When they that came to take him 
 were thunder-struck with a word,--when Judas confessed him innocent, and
 sealed that confession with his own guilty blood,--when the judge's wife
 asleep, and the judge himself awake, pronounced him righteous,--when the
 sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple rent, then the Father not
 only justified, but glorified the Son. Nay, <I>Secondly,</I> Even by
 his sufferings; when he was crucified, he was magnified, he was
 glorified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:31"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 31</A>.

 It was in his cross that he conquered Satan and death; his thorns were 
 a crown, and Pilate in the inscription over his head wrote more than he 
 thought. But, <I>Thirdly,</I> Much more after his sufferings. The 
 Father glorified the Son when he <I>raised him from the dead,</I> 
 showed him openly to chosen witnesses, and poured out the Spirit to 
 support and plead his cause, and to set up his kingdom among men, then 
 he <I>glorified him.</I> This he here prays for, and insists upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What he pleads to enforce this request.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He pleads relation: <I>Glorify thy Son;</I> thy Son as 
 God, as Mediator. It is in consideration of this that the heathen are 
 <I>given him for his inheritance;</I> for <I>thou art my Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7,8">Ps. ii. 7, 8</A>.

 The devil had tempted him to renounce his sonship with an offer of the
 kingdoms of this world; but he rejected the offer with disdain, and 
 depended upon his Father for his preferment, and here applies himself 
 to him for it. Note, Those that have received the adoption of sons may 
 in faith pray for the inheritance of sons; if sanctified, then 
 glorified: <I>Father, glorify thy Son.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He pleads the time: <I>The hour is come;</I> the season
 prefixed to an hour. The hour of Christ's passion was determined in the 
 counsel of God. He had often said his hour was not yet come; but now it 
 was come, and he knew it. <I>Man knows not his time</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:12">Eccl. ix. 12</A>),
 
 but the Son of man did. He calls it <I>this hour</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:27"><I>ch.</I> xii. 27</A>),

 and here, <I>the hour;</I> compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:35,Joh+16:21">Mark xiv. 35; <I>ch.</I> xvi. 21</A>.

 For the hour of the Redeemer's death, which was also the hour of the
 Redeemer's birth, was the most signal and remarkable hour, and, without 
 doubt, the most critical, that ever was since the clock of time was 
 first set a going. Never was there such an hour as that, nor did ever
 any hour challenge such expectations of it before, nor such reflections 
 upon it after. 

 1. "<I>The hour is come</I> in the midst of which I need to be owned."
 Now is the hour when this grand affair is come to a crisis; after many 
 a skirmish the decisive battle between heaven and hell is now to be 
 fought, and that great cause in which God's honour and man's happiness 
 are together embarked must now be either won or lost for ever. The two 
 champions David and Goliath, Michael and the dragon, are now entering 
 the lists; the trumpet sounds for an engagement that will be 
 irretrievably fatal either to the one or to the other: "<I>Now glorify 
 thy Son,</I> now give him victory over <I>principalities and 
 powers,</I> now let <I>the bruising of his heel</I> be <I>the breaking 
 of the serpent's head,</I> now let thy Son be so upheld as not to fail 
 nor be discouraged." When Joshua went <I>forth conquering and to 
 conquer,</I> it is said, <I>The Lord magnified Joshua;</I> so he 
 <I>glorified his Son</I> when he made the cross his triumphant chariot.
 
 2. "<I>The hour is come</I> in the close of which I expect to be
 crowned; <I>the hour is come</I> when I am <I>to be glorified,</I> and, 
 <I>set at thy right hand.</I>" Betwixt him and that glory there 
 intervened a bloody scene of suffering; but, being short, he speaks as 
 if he made little of it: <I>The hour is come that I must be 
 glorified;</I> and he did not expect it till then. Good Christians in a 
 trying hour, particularly a dying hour, may thus plead: "<I>Now the 
 hour is come,</I> stand by me, appear for me, now or never: now <I>the 
 earthly tabernacle is to be dissolved, the hour is come that I should 
 be glorified.</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:1">2 Cor. v. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> He pleads the Father's own interest and concern herein: 
 <I>That thy Son may also glorify thee;</I> for he had consecrated his 
 whole undertaking to his Father's honour. He desired to be carried 
 triumphantly through his sufferings to his glory, that he might glorify 
 the Father two ways:--

 1. By <I>the death of the cross,</I> which he was now to suffer.
 <I>Father, glorify thy name,</I> expressed the great intention of his 
 sufferings, which was to retrieve his Father's injured honour among 
 men, and, by his satisfaction, to come up to the glory of God, which 
 man, by his sin, came short of: "Father, own me in my sufferings, that 
 I may honour thee by them." 

 2. By the doctrine of the cross, which was now shortly to be published
 to the world, by which God's kingdom was to be re-established among 
 men. He prays that his Father would so grace his sufferings, and crown 
 them, as not only to take off <I>the offence of the cross,</I> but to 
 make it, <I>to those that are saved, the wisdom of God and the power of 
 God.</I> If God had not glorified Christ crucified, <I>by raising him 
 from the dead,</I> his whole undertaking had been crushed; therefore 
 <I>glorify me, that I may glorify thee.</I> Now thereby he hath taught 
 us,

 (1.) What to eye and aim at in our prayers, in all our designs and 
 desires--and that is, the honour of God. It being our chief end to 
 glorify God, other things must be sought and attended to in 
 subordination and subserviency to the Lord. "Do this and the other for 
 thy servant, that thy servant may glorify thee. Give me health, that I 
 may glorify thee with my body; success, that I may glorify thee with my 
 estate," &c. <I>Hallowed be thy name</I> must be our first petition, 
 which must fix our end in all our other petitions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:11">1 Peter iv. 11</A>.

 (2.) He hath taught us what to expect and hope for. If we sincerely set 
 ourselves to glorify our Father, he will not be wanting to do that for 
 us which is requisite to put us into a capacity of glorifying him, to 
 give us the grace he knows sufficient, and the opportunity he sees 
 convenient. But, if we secretly honour ourselves more than him, it is 
 just with him to leave us in the hand of our own counsels, and then, 
 instead of honouring ourselves, we shall shame ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> He pleads his commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>);

 he desires to glorify his Father, in conformity to, and in pursuance 
 of, the commission given him: "<I>Glorify thy Son, as thou hast given 
 him power, glorify him in the execution of the powers thou hast given 
 him,</I>" so it is connected with the petition; or, <I>that thy Son may 
 glorify thee</I> according to <I>the power given him,</I> so it is 
 connected with the plea. Now see here the power of the Mediator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> The origin of his power: <I>Thou hast given him power;</I> he 
 has it from God, <I>to whom all power belongs.</I> Man, in his fallen 
 state, must, in order to his recovery, be taken under a new model of 
 government, which could not be erected but by a special commission 
 under the broad seal of heaven, directed to the undertaker of that 
 glorious work, and constituting him sole arbitrator of the grand 
 difference that was, and sole guarantee of the grand alliance that was 
 to be, between God and man; so as to this office, he received his 
 power, which was to be executed in a way distinct from his power and 
 government as Creator. Note, The church's king is no usurper, as the 
 prince of this world is; Christ's right to rule is incontestable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> The extent of his power: He has <I>power over all flesh.</I> 
 
 (<I>a.</I>) Over all mankind. He has power in and over the world of 
 spirits, the powers of the upper and unseen world are subject to him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22">1 Peter iii. 22</A>);

 but, being now mediating between God and man, he here <I>pleads his 
 power over all flesh.</I> They were men whom he was to subdue and save; 
 out of that race he had a remnant given him, and therefore all that 
 rank of beings was <I>put under his feet.</I> 

 (<I>b.</I>) Over mankind considered as corrupt and fallen, for so he is 
 called <I>flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:3">Gen. vi. 3</A>.

 If he had not in this sense been flesh, he had not needed a Redeemer.
 Over this sinful race the Lord Jesus has all power; and <I>all 
 judgment,</I> concerning them, <I>is committed to him;</I> power to 
 bind or loose, acquit or condemn; <I>power on earth to forgive sins</I> 
 or not. Christ, as Mediator, has the government of the whole world put 
 into his hand; he is king of nations, has power even over those <I>that 
 know him not, nor obey his gospel;</I> whom he does not rule, he 
 over-rules,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:28,72:8,Mt+28:18,Joh+3:35">Ps. xxii. 28; lxxii. 8; 
 Matt. xxviii. 18; <I>ch.</I> iii. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>c.</I> The grand intention and design of this power: <I>That he 
 should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</I> Here is 
 the mystery of our salvation laid open.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) Here is the Father making over the elect to the Redeemer, 
 and giving them to him as his charge and trust; as the crown and 
 recompence of his undertaking. He has a sovereign power over all the 
 fallen race, but a peculiar interest in the chosen remnant; <I>all 
 things were put under his feet,</I> but they were <I>delivered into his 
 hand.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) Here is the Son undertaking to secure the happiness of 
 those that were given him, that he would <I>give eternal life to 
 them.</I> See how great the authority of the Redeemer is. He has lives 
 and crowns to give, eternal lives that never die, immortal crowns that 
 never fade. Now consider how great the Lord Jesus is, who has such 
 preferments in his gift; and how gracious he is in giving eternal life 
 to those whom he undertakes to save. 

 [<I>a.</I>] He sanctifies them in this world, gives them the spiritual 
 life which is eternal life in the bud and embryo,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:14"><I>ch.</I> iv. 14</A>.

 Grace in the soul is heaven in that soul.

 [<I>b.</I>] He will glorify them in the other world; their happiness 
 shall be completed in the vision and fruition of God. This only is 
 mentioned, because it supposes all the other parts of his undertaking, 
 teaching them, satisfying for them, sanctifying them, and preparing 
 them for that eternal life; and indeed all the other were in order to 
 this; we are <I>called to his kingdom and glory,</I> and <I>begotten to 
 the inheritance.</I> What is last in execution was first in intention, 
 and <I>that is eternal life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>c.</I>) Here is the subserviency of the Redeemer's universal 
 dominion to this: He has <I>power over all flesh,</I> on purpose that 
 he might give eternal life to the select number. Note, Christ's 
 dominion over the children of men is in order to the salvation of the 
 children of God. <I>All things are for their sakes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:15">2 Cor. iv. 15</A>.

 All Christ's laws, ordinances, and promises, which are given to all, 
 are designed effectually to convey spiritual life, and secure eternal 
 life, to all that were given to Christ; he is <I>head over all things 
 to the church.</I> The administration of the kingdoms of providence and 
 grace are put into the same hand, that all things may be made to concur 
 for good to the called.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>d.</I> Here is a further explication of this grand design 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 "<I>This is life eternal,</I> which I am empowered and have undertaken 
 to give, this is the nature of it, and this the way leading to it, 
 <I>to know thee the only true God,</I> and all the discoveries and 
 principles of natural religion, and Jesus Christ whom, thou has sent, 
 as Mediator, and the doctrines and laws of that holy religion which he 
 instituted for the recovery of man out of his lapsed state." Here 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) The great end which the Christian religion sets before us, 
 and that is, eternal life, the happiness of an immortal soul in the 
 vision and fruition of an eternal God. This he was to reveal to all, 
 and secure to all that were given him. By the gospel <I>life and 
 immortality are brought to light,</I> are brought to hand, a life which 
 transcends this as much in excellency as it does in duration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) The sure way of attaining this blessed end, which is, by 
 the right knowledge of God and Jesus Christ: "<I>This is life eternal, 
 to know thee,</I>" which may be taken two ways--

 [<I>a.</I>] <I>Life eternal</I> lies in the knowledge of God and Jesus 
 Christ; the present principle of this life is the believing knowledge 
 of God and Christ; the future perfection of that life will be the 
 intuitive knowledge of God and Christ. Those that are brought into 
 union with Christ, and live a life of communion with God in Christ, 
 know, in some measure, by experience, what eternal life is, and will 
 say, "If this be heaven, heaven is sweet." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:15">Ps. xvii. 15</A>.

 [<I>b.</I>] The knowledge of God and Christ leads to life eternal; this
 is the way in which Christ gives eternal life, by the knowledge of him 
 that has called us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:3">2 Peter i. 3</A>),
 
 and this is the way in which we come to receive it. The Christian 
 religion shows us the way to heaven, <I>First,</I> By directing us to 
 God, as the author and felicity of our being; for Christ died to 
 <I>bring us to God.</I> To know him as our Creator, and to love him, 
 obey him, submit to him, and trust in him, as our owner ruler, and 
 benefactor,--to devote ourselves to him as our sovereign Lord, depend
 upon him as our chief good, and direct all to his praise as our highest 
 end,--<I>this is life eternal.</I> God is here called the <I>only true
 God,</I> to distinguish him from the false gods of the heathen, which 
 were counterfeits and pretenders, not from the person of the Son, of 
 whom it is expressly said that he is <I>the true God and eternal 
 life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:20">1 John v. 20</A>),

 and who in this text is proposed as the object of the same religious 
 regard with the Father. It is certain there is but one only living and 
 true God and the God we adore is he. He is the true God, and not a mere 
 name or notion; the only true God, and all that ever set up as rivals 
 with him are vanity and a lie; the service of him is the only true 
 religion. <I>Secondly,</I> By directing us to Jesus Christ, as the 
 Mediator between God and man: <I>Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</I> 
 If man had continued innocent, the knowledge of the only true God would 
 have been life eternal to him; but now that he is fallen there must be 
 something more; now that we are under guilt, to know God is to know him 
 as a righteous Judge, whose curse we are under; and nothing is more 
 killing than to know this. We are therefore concerned to know Christ as 
 our Redeemer, by whom alone we can now have access to God; it is life 
 eternal to believe in Christ; and this he has undertaken to give to as 
 many as were given him. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:39,40"><I>ch.</I> vi. 39, 40</A>.

 Those that are acquainted with God and Christ are already in the
 suburbs of life eternal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ here prays to be glorified in consideration of his having
 glorified the Father hitherto, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 The meaning of the former petition was, Glorify me in this world; the 
 meaning of the latter is, Glorify me in the other world. <I>I have 
 glorified thee on the earth, and now glorify thou me.</I> Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] With what comfort Christ reflects on the life he had lived on 
 earth: <I>I have glorified thee, and finished my work;</I> it is as 
 good as finished. He does not complain of the poverty and disgrace he 
 had lived in, what a weary life he had upon earth, as ever any man of 
 sorrows had. He overlooks this, and pleases himself in reviewing the 
 service he had done his Father, and the progress he had made in his 
 understanding. This is here recorded, <I>First,</I> For the honour of 
 Christ, that his life upon earth did in all respects fully answer the 
 end of his coming into the world. Note, 

 1. Our Lord Jesus had work given him to do by him that sent him; he
 came not into the world to live at ease, but to go <I>about doing 
 good,</I> and to <I>fulfill all righteousness.</I> His Father gave him 
 his work, his work in the vineyard, both appointed him to it and 
 assisted him in it. 

 2. <I>The work that was given him to do</I> he finished. Though he had
 not, as yet, gone through the last part of his undertaking, yet he was 
 so near being <I>made perfect through sufferings</I> that he might say, 
 I have finished it; it was as good as done, he was giving it its 
 finishing stroke <B><I>eteleiosa</I></B>--<I>I have finished.</I> The 
 word signifies his performing every part of his undertaking in the most 
 complete and perfect manner. 

 3. Herein he glorified his Father; he pleased him, he praised him. It
 is the glory of God that <I>his work is perfect,</I> and the same is 
 the glory of the Redeemer; what he is the author of he will be the 
 finisher of. It was a strange way for the Son to glorify the Father by 
 abasing himself (this looked more likely to disparage him), yet it was 
 contrived that so he should glorify him: "<I>I have glorified thee on 
 the earth,</I> in such a way as men on earth could bear the 
 manifestation of thy glory." <I>Secondly,</I> It is recorded for 
 example to all, <I>that we may follow his example.</I>

 1. We must make it our business to do the work God has appointed us to
 do, according to our capacity and the sphere of our activity; we must 
 each of us do all the good we can in this world. 

 2. We must aim at the glory of God in all. We must glorify him on the
 earth, which he has given <I>unto the children of men,</I> demanding 
 only this quit-rent; on the earth, where we are in a state of probation 
 and preparation for eternity. 

 3. We must persevere herein to the end of our days; we must not sit
 down till we have finished our work, and <I>accomplished as a hireling 
 our day. Thirdly,</I> It is recorded for encouragement to all those
 that rest upon him. If he has <I>finished the work that was given him 
 to do,</I> then he is a complete Saviour, and did not do his work by 
 the halves. And he that finished his work for us will finish it in us 
 <I>to the day of Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] See with what confidence he expects <I>the joy set before him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Now, O Father, glorify thou me.</I> It is what he depends upon, and 
 cannot be denied him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> See here what he prayed for: <I>Glorify thou me,</I> as 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 All repetitions in prayer are not to be counted <I>vain 
 repetitions;</I> Christ <I>prayed, saying the same words</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:44">Matt. xxvi. 44</A>),

 and yet <I>prayed more earnestly.</I> What his Father had promised him, 
 and he was assured of, yet he must pray for; promises are not designed 
 to supersede prayers, but to be the guide of our desires and the ground 
 of our hopes. Christ's being glorified includes all the honours, 
 powers, and joys, of his exalted state. See how it is described. 

 1. It is a glory with God; not only, <I>Glorify my name on earth,</I>
 but, <I>Glorify me with thine own self.</I> It was paradise, it was 
 heaven, to be with his Father, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30,Da+7:13,Heb+8:1">Prov. viii. 30;
 Dan. vii. 13; Heb. viii. 1</A>.

 Note, The brightest glories of the exalted Redeemer were to be 
 displayed within the veil, where the Father manifests his glory. The 
 praises of the upper world are offered up <I>to him that sits upon the 
 throne and to the lamb</I> in conjunction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:13">Rev. v. 13</A>),

 and the prayers of the lower world draw out grace and peace <I>from God 
 our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ</I> in conjunction; and thus the 
 Father has glorified him with himself. 

 2. It is <I>the glory he had with God before the world was.</I> By this
 it appears,

 (1.) That Jesus Christ, as God, had a being <I>before the world 
 was,</I> co-eternal with the Father; our religion acquaints us with one 
 that <I>was before all things, and by whom all things consist.</I> 

 (2.) That his glory with the Father is from everlasting, as well as his 
 existence with the Father; for he was from eternity <I>the brightness 
 of his Father's glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb. i. 3</A>.

 As God's making the world only declared his glory, but made no real 
 additions to it; so Christ undertook the work of redemption, not 
 because he needed glory, for he had a glory <I>with the Father before 
 the world,</I> but because we needed glory. 

 (3.) That Jesus Christ in his state of humiliation divested himself of 
 this glory, and drew a veil over it; though he was still God, yet he 
 was <I>God manifested in the flesh,</I> not in his glory. He laid down 
 this glory for a time, as a pledge that he would go through with his 
 undertaking, according to the appointment of his Father. 

 (4.) That in his exalted state he resumed this glory, and clad himself 
 again with his former robes of light. Having performed his undertaking, 
 he did, as it were, <I>reposcere pignus--take up his pledge,</I> by 
 this demand, <I>Glorify thou me.</I> He prays that even his human 
 nature might be advanced to the highest honour it was capable of, his 
 body a glorious body; and that the glory of the Godhead might now be 
 manifested in the person of the Mediator, Emmanuel, God-man. He does 
 not pray to be glorified with the princes and great men of the earth: 
 no; he that knew both worlds, and might choose which he would have his 
 preferment in, chose it in the glory of the other world, as far 
 exceeding all the glory of this. He had despised <I>the kingdoms of 
 this world and the glory of them,</I> when Satan offered them to him, 
 and therefore might the more boldly claim the glories of the other 
 world. <I>Let the same mind be in us.</I> "Lord, give the glories of 
 this world to whom thou wilt give them, but let me have my portion of 
 glory in the world to come. It is no matter, though I be vilified with 
 men; but, <I>Father, glorify thou me with thine own self.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> See here what he pleaded: <I>I have glorified
 thee;</I> and now, in consideration thereof, <I>glorify thou me.</I> 
 For,

 1. There was an equity in it, and an admirable becomingness, <I>that if
 God was glorified in him, he should glorify him in himself,</I> as he 
 had observed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:32"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 32</A>.

 Such an infinite value there was in what Christ did to glorify his
 Father that he properly merited all the glories of his exalted state. 
 If the Father was a gainer in his glory by the Son's humiliation, it 
 was fit the Son should be no loser by it at long run, in his glory. 

 2. It was according to the covenant between them, that if the Son
 would <I>make his soul an offering for sin</I> he should <I>divide the 
 spoil with the strong</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10,12">Isa. liii. 10, 12</A>),

 and <I>the kingdom should be his;</I> and this he had an eye to, and 
 depended upon, in his sufferings; it was <I>for the joy set before 
 him</I> that <I>he endured the cross:</I> and now in his exalted state 
 he still expects the completing of his exaltation, because he perfected 
 his undertaking,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:13">Heb. x. 13</A>.

 3. It was the most proper evidence of his Father's accepting and 
 approving the work he had finished. By the glorifying of Christ we are 
 satisfied that God was satisfied, and therein a real demonstration was 
 given that the Father was well pleased in him as his beloved Son. 

 4. Thus we must be taught that those, and only those, who glorify God
 on earth, and persevere in the work God hath given them to do, shall be 
 glorified with the Father, when they must be no more in this world. Not 
 that we can merit the glory, as Christ did, but our glorifying God is 
 required as an evidence of our interest in Christ, through whom eternal 
 life is God's free gift.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me
 out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and
 they have kept thy word.
 &nbsp; 7  Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast
 given me are of thee.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ, having prayed for himself, comes next to pray for those that 
 are his, and he knew them by name, though he did not here name them. 
 Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Whom he did not pray for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>I pray not for the world.</I> Note, There is a world of people that 
 Jesus Christ did not pray for. It is not meant of the world of mankind 
 general (he prays for that here,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>,

 <I>That the world may believe that thou hast sent me</I>); nor is it 
 meant of the Gentiles, in distinction from the Jews; but the world is 
 here opposed to the elect, who are given to Christ out of the world. 
 Take the world for a heap of unwinnowed corn in the floor, and God 
 loves it, Christ prays for it, and dies for it, <I>for a blessing is in 
 it;</I> but, <I>the Lord perfectly knowing those that are his,</I> he 
 eyes particularly those <I>that were given him out of the world,</I> 
 extracts them; and then take the world for the remaining heap of 
 rejected, worthless chaff, and Christ neither prays for it, nor dies 
 for it, but abandons it, and <I>the wind drives it away.</I> These are 
 called <I>the world,</I> because they are governed by the spirit of 
 this world, and have their portion in it; for these Christ does not 
 pray; not but that there are some things which he intercedes with God 
 for on their behalf, as the dresser for the reprieve of the barren 
 tree; but he does not pray for them in this prayer, that <I>have not 
 part nor lot</I> in the blessings here prayed for. He does not say, I 
 pray against the world, as Elias made intercession against Israel; but, 
 <I>I pray not for them,</I> I pass them by, and leave them to 
 themselves; they are <I>not written in the Lamb's book of life,</I> and 
 therefore not in the breast-plate of the great high-priest. And 
 miserable is the condition of such, as it was of those whom the prophet 
 was forbidden to pray for, and more so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:16">Jer. vii. 16</A>.

 We that know not who are chosen, and who are passed by, must <I>pray
 for all men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:1,4">1 Tim. ii. 1, 4</A>.

 While there is life, there is hope, and room for prayer. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:23">1 Sam. xii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Whom he did pray for; not for angels, but for the children of men. 
 
 1. He prays <I>for those that were given him,</I> meaning primarily the
 disciples that had attended <I>him in this regeneration;</I> but it is 
 doubtless to be extended further, to all who come under the same 
 character, who receive and believe the words of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:6,8"><I>v.</I> 6, 8</A>.

 2. He prays <I>for all that should believe on him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and it is not only the petitions that follow, but those also which went 
 before, that must be construed to extend to all believers, in every 
 place and every age; for he has a concern for them all, and calls 
 <I>things that are not as though they were.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What encouragement he had to pray for them, and what are the 
 general pleas with which he introduces his petitions for them, and 
 recommends them to his Father's favour; they are five:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The charge he had received concerning them: <I>Thine they were, and 
 thou gavest them me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>Thou whom thou hast given me.</I> "Father, those I am now praying 
 for are such as thou hast entrusted me with, and what I have to say for 
 them is in pursuance of the charge I have received concerning them." 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This is meant primarily of the disciples that then were, who were 
 given to Christ as his pupils to be educated by him while he was on 
 earth, and his agents to be employed for him when he went to heaven. 
 They were given him to be the learners of his doctrine, the witnesses 
 of his life and miracles, and the monuments of his grace and favour, in 
 order to their being the publishers of his gospel and the planters of 
 his church. When they left all to follow him, this was the secret 
 spring of that strange resolution: they were given to him, else they 
 had not given themselves to him. Note, The apostleship and ministry,
 which are Christ's gift to the church, were first the Father's gift to
 Jesus Christ. As under the law the Levites were given to Aaron 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:9">Num. iii. 9</A>),

 to him (the <I>great high priest of our profession</I>) the Father gave
 the apostles first, and ministers in every age, <I>to keep his charge, 
 and the charge of the whole congregation, and to do the service of the 
 tabernacle.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8,11,Ps+68:18">Eph. iv. 8, 11; Ps. lxviii. 18</A>.

 Christ received this gift for men, that he might give it to men. As 
 this puts a great honour upon the ministry of the gospel, and magnifies 
 that office, which is so much vilified; so it lays a mighty obligation 
 upon the ministers of the gospel to devote themselves entirely to 
 Christ's service, as being <I>given to him,</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) But it is designed to extend to all the elect, for they are 
 elsewhere said to be given to Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:37,39"><I>ch.</I> vi. 37, 39</A>),

 and he often laid a stress upon this, that those he was to save were
 given to him as his charge; to his care they were committed, from his 
 hand they were expected, and concerning them he received commandments. 
 He here shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That the Father had authority to give them: <I>Thine they 
 were.</I> He did not give that which was none of his own, but 
 covenanted that he had a good title. The elect, whom the Father gave to 
 Christ, were his own in three ways:--<I>First,</I> they were creatures,
 and their lives and beings were derived from him. When they were given 
 to Christ to be <I>vessels of honour,</I> they were <I>in his hand, as 
 clay in the hand of the potter,</I> to be disposed of as God's wisdom 
 saw most for God's glory. <I>Secondly,</I> They were criminals, and
 their lives and beings were forfeited to him. It was a remnant of 
 fallen mankind that was given to Christ to be redeemed, that might have 
 been made sacrifices to justice when they were pitched upon to be the 
 <I>monuments of mercy;</I> might justly have been <I>delivered to the 
 tormentors</I> when they were delivered to the Saviour. <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 They were chosen, and their lives and beings were designed, for him; 
 they were set apart for God, and were consigned to Christ as his agent. 
 This he insists upon again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>All things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee,</I> which, 
 though it may take in all that appertained to his office as Mediator, 
 yet seems especially to be meant of those that were given him. "They 
 <I>are of thee,</I> their being is of thee as the God of nature, their 
 well-being is of thee as the God of grace; they <I>are all of thee,</I> 
 and therefore, Father, I bring them all to thee, that they may be all 
 for thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That he did accordingly give them to the Son. <I>Thou gavest them 
 to me,</I> as sheep to the shepherd, to be kept; as patients to the 
 physician, to be cured; children to a tutor, to be educated; thus he 
 will deliver up his charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:13">Heb. ii. 13</A>),

 <I>The children thou hast given me.</I> They were delivered to Christ, 
 <I>First,</I> That the election of grace might not be frustrated, 
 <I>that not one,</I> no not <I>of the little ones, might perish.</I> 
 That great concern must be lodged in some one good hand, able to give 
 sufficient security, <I>that the purpose of God according to election 
 might stand. Secondly,</I> That the undertaking of Christ might not be 
 fruitless; they were <I>given to him as his seed,</I> in whom he should 
 <I>see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10,11">Isa. liii. 10, 11</A>),

 and might not <I>spend his strength,</I> and shed his blood, <I>for 
 nought, and in vain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:4">Isa. xlix. 4</A>.

 We may plead, as Christ does, "Lord, keep my graces, keep my comforts, 
 for <I>thine they were, and thou gavest them to me.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The care he had taken of them to teach them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I have manifested thy name to them. I have given to them the words 
 which thou gavest to me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The great design of Christ's doctrine, which was to manifest God's 
 name, to declare him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>),

 to instruct the ignorant, and rectify the mistakes of a dark and
 foolish world concerning God, that he might be better loved and 
 worshipped.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His faithful discharge of this undertaking: <I>I have</I> done it. 
 His fidelity appears, 

 [1.] In the truth of the doctrine. It agreed exactly with the 
 instructions he received from his Father. He gave not only the things, 
 but the very <I>words, that were given him.</I> Ministers, in wording 
 their message, must have an eye to <I>the words which the Holy Ghost 
 teaches.</I> 

 [2.] In the tendency of his doctrine, which was to manifest God's name. 
 He did not seek himself, but, in all he did and said, aimed to magnify 
 his Father. Note, <I>First,</I> It is Christ's prerogative to manifest 
 God's name to the souls of the children of men. <I>No man knows the
 Father, but he to whom the Son will reveal him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>.

 He only has acquaintance with the Father, and so is able to open the 
 truth; and he only has access to the spirits of men, and so is able to 
 open the understanding. Ministers may <I>publish the name of the 
 Lord</I> (as Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:3">Deut. xxxii. 3</A>),

 but Christ only can manifest that name. By the word of Christ God is
 revealed to us; by the Spirit of Christ God is revealed in us. 
 Ministers may speak the words of God to us, but Christ can give us his 
 words, can put them in us, as food, as treasure. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 Sooner or later, Christ will manifest God's name to all that were given 
 him, and will give them his word, to be the seed of their new birth, 
 the support of their spiritual life, and the earnest of their 
 everlasting bliss.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The good effect of the care he had taken of them, and the pains he 
 had taken with them, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>They have kept they word</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>they have known that all things are of thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 <I>they have received thy words,</I> and embraced them, have given 
 their assent and consent to them, <I>and have known surely that I came 
 out from thee, and have believed that thou didst send me.</I> Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What success the doctrine of Christ had among those <I>that were 
 given to him,</I> in several particulars:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] "They have received the words which I gave them, as the ground 
 receives the seed, and the earth drinks in the rain." They attended to 
 the words of Christ, apprehended in some measure the meaning of them, 
 and were affected with them: they received the impression of them. The 
 word was to them an <I>ingrafted word.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] "<I>They have kept thy word,</I> have continued in it; they have 
 conformed to it." Christ's commandment is then only kept when it is 
 obeyed. Those that have to teach others the commands of Christ ought to 
 be themselves observant of them. It was requisite that these should 
 <I>keep what was committed to them,</I> for it was to be transmitted by 
 them to every place for every age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] "They have understood the word, and have been sensible on what 
 ground they went in receiving and keeping it. They have been aware that 
 thou art the original author of that holy religion which I am come to 
 institute, <I>that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of 
 thee.</I>" All Christ's offices and powers, all the gifts of the
 Spirit, all his graces and comforts, which God <I>gave without measure
 to him,</I> were all from God, contrived by his wisdom, appointed by
 his will, and designed by his grace, for his own glory in man's
 salvation. Note, It is a great satisfaction to us, in our reliance upon
 Christ, that he, and all he is and has, all he said and did, all he is
 doing and will do, are of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:30">1 Cor. i. 30</A>.

 We may therefore venture our souls upon Christ's mediation, for it has 
 a good bottom. If the righteousness be of God's appointing, we shall be 
 justified; if the grace be of his dispensing, we shall be 
 sanctified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] They have set their seal to it: <I>They have known surely that I 
 came out from God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 See here, <I>First,</I> What it is to believe; it is to <I>know 
 surely,</I> to know <I>that it is so of a truth.</I> The disciples were 
 very weak and defective in knowledge; yet Christ, who knew them better 
 than they knew themselves, passes his word for them that they did 
 believe. Note, We may know surely that which we neither do nor can know 
 fully; <I>may know the certainty of the things which are not seen,</I> 
 though we cannot particularly describe the nature of them. <I>We walk 
 by faith,</I> which knows surely, <I>not yet by sight,</I> which knows 
 clearly. <I>Secondly,</I> What it is we are to believe: <I>that Jesus 
 Christ came out from God,</I> as he is the Son of God, in his person 
 <I>the image of the invisible God,</I> and that God did not send him; 
 that in his undertaking he is the ambassador of the eternal king: so 
 that the Christian religion stands upon the same footing, and is of 
 equal authority, with natural religion; and therefore all the doctrines 
 of Christ are to be received as divine truths, all his commands obeyed 
 as divine laws, and all his promises depended upon as divine 
 securities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How Jesus Christ here speaks of this: he enlarges upon it, 

 [1.] As pleased with it himself. Though the many instances of his 
 disciples' dulness and weakness had grieved him, yet their constant 
 adherence to him, their gradual improvements, and their great 
 attainments at last, were his joy. Christ is a Master that delights in 
 the proficiency of his scholars. He accepts the sincerity of their 
 faith, and graciously passes by the infirmity of it. See how willing he 
 is to make the best of us, and to say the best of us, thereby 
 encouraging our faith in him, and teaching us charity to one another,

 [2.] As pleading it with the Father. He is praying for <I>those that
 were given to him;</I> and he pleads that they had given themselves to 
 him. Note, The due improvement of grace received is a good plea, 
 according to the tenour of the new covenant, for further grace; for so 
 runs the promise. <I>To him that hath shall be given.</I> Those that 
 keep Christ's word, and believe on him, let Christ alone to commend 
 them, and, which is more, to recommend them to his Father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He pleads the Father's own interest in them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>I pray for them, for they are thine;</I> and this by virtue of a 
 joint and mutual interest, which he and the Father have in what 
 pertained to each: <I>All mine are thine, and thine are mine.</I> 
 Between the Father and Son there can be no dispute (as there is among 
 the children of men) about <I>meum</I> and <I>tuum--mine and thine,</I> 
 for the matter was settled from eternity; <I>all mine are thine, and 
 thine are mine.</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The plea particularly urged for his disciples: <I>They are 
 thine.</I> The consigning of the elect to Christ was so far from making 
 them less the Father's that it was in order to making them the more so. 
 Note, 

 [1.] All that receive Christ's word, and believe in him, are taken into 
 covenant-relation to the Father, and are looked upon as his; Christ 
 presents them to him, and they, through Christ, present themselves to 
 him. Christ has <I>redeemed us,</I> not to himself only, but <I>to God, 
 by his blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:9,10">Rev. v. 9, 10</A>.

 They are <I>first-fruits unto God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:4">Rev. xiv. 4</A>.

 [2.] This is a good plea in prayer, Christ here pleads it, <I>They are
 thine;</I> we may plead it for ourselves, <I>I am thine, save me;</I>
 and for others (as Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:11">Exod. xxxii. 11</A>),

 "<I>They are thy people. They are thine;</I> wilt thou not provide for
 thine own? Wilt thou not secure them, that they may not be run down by 
 the devil and the world? Wilt thou not secure thy interest in them, 
 that they may not depart from thee? <I>They are thine,</I> own them as 
 thine."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The foundation on which this plea is grounded: <I>All mine are 
 thine, and thine are mine.</I> This bespeaks the Father and Son to be, 
 
 [1.] One in essence. Every creature must say to God, <I>All mine are
 thine;</I> but none can say to him, <I>All thine are mine,</I> but he
 that is the same in substance with him and equal in power and glory.
 
 [2.] One in interest; no separate or divided interests between them.
 <I>First,</I> What the Father has as Creator is delivered over to the
 Son, to be used and disposed of in subserviency to his great
 undertaking. <I>All things are delivered to him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>);

 the grant is so general that nothing is excepted but <I>he that did put 
 all things under him. Secondly,</I> What the Son has as Redeemer is 
 designed for the Father, and his kingdom shall shortly be delivered up 
 to him. All the benefits of redemption, purchased by the Son, are 
 intended for the Father's praise, and in his glory all the lines of his 
 undertaking centre: <I>All mine are thine.</I> The Son owns none for 
 his that are not devoted to the service of the Father; nor will any 
 thing be accepted as a piece of service to the Christian religion which 
 clashes with the dictates and laws of natural religion. In a limited 
 sense, every true believer may say, <I>All thine are mine;</I> if God 
 be ours in covenant, all he is and has is so far ours that it shall be 
 engaged for our good; and in an unlimited sense every true believer 
 does say, Lord, <I>all mine are thine;</I> all laid at his feet, to be 
 serviceable to him. And what we have may be comfortably committed to 
 God's care and blessing when it is cheerfully submitted to his
 government and disposal: "Lord, take care of what I have, for it is 
 <I>all thine.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He pleads his own concern in them: <I>I am glorified in 
 them</I>--<B><I>dedoxasmai</I></B>. 

 (1.) <I>I have been glorified in them.</I> What little honour Christ 
 had in this world was among his disciples; he had been glorified by 
 their attendance on him and obedience to him, their preaching and 
 working miracles in his name; and therefore <I>I pray for them.</I> 
 Note, Those shall have an interest in Christ's intercession in and by 
 whom he is glorified. 

 (2.) "<I>I am to be glorified in them</I> when I am gone to heaven; 
 they are to bear up my name." The apostles preached and wrought 
 miracles <I>in Christ's name; the Spirit in them glorified Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:14"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 14</A>):

 "<I>I am glorified in them,</I> and therefore," 

 [1.] "I concern myself for them." What little interest Christ has in 
 this degenerate world lies in his church; and therefore it and all its 
 affairs lie near his heart, within the veil. 

 [2.] "Therefore I commit them to the Father, who has engaged to glorify 
 the Son, and, upon this account, will have a gracious eye to those in 
 whom he is glorified." That in which God and Christ are glorified may, 
 with humble confidence, be committed to God's special care.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the
 world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own
 name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we
 <I>are.</I>
 &nbsp; 12  While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:
 those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost,
 but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 13  And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the
 world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
 &nbsp; 14  I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
 because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
 &nbsp; 15  I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world,
 but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.
 &nbsp; 16  They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the general pleas with which Christ recommended his disciples to 
 his Father's care follow the particular petitions he puts up for them; 
 and, 

 1. They all relate to spiritual blessings in heavenly things. He does
 not pray that they might be rich and great in the world, that they 
 might raise estates and get preferments, but that they might be kept 
 from sin, and furnished for their duty, and brought safely to heaven.
 Note, The prosperity of the soul is the best prosperity; for what 
 relates to this Christ came to purchase and bestow, and so teaches us 
 to seek, in the first place, both for others and for ourselves. 

 2. They are such blessings as were suited to their present state and
 case, and their various exigencies and occasions. Note, Christ's 
 intercession is always pertinent. Our <I>advocate with the Father</I> 
 is acquainted with all the particulars of our wants and burdens, our 
 dangers and difficulties, and knows how to accommodate his intercession 
 to each, as to Peter's peril, which he himself was not aware of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:32">Luke xxii. 32</A>),

 <I>I have prayed for thee.</I> 

 3. He is large and full in the petitions, orders them before his 
 Father, and <I>fills his mouth with arguments,</I> to teach us fervency 
 and importunity in prayer, to be large in prayer, and dwell upon our 
 errands at the throne of grace, wrestling as Jacob, <I>I will not let 
 thee go, except thou bless me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the first thing Christ prays for, for his disciples, is their 
 preservation, in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11-16">these verses</A>,

 in order to which he commits them all to his Father's custody. Keeping
 supposes danger, and their danger arose <I>from the world,</I> the 
 world wherein they were, <I>the evil</I> of this he begs they might be 
 kept from. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The request itself: <I>Keep them from the world.</I> There were two 
 ways of their being delivered from the world:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By taking them out of it; and he does not pray that they might be so 
 delivered: <I>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the 
 world;</I> that is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) "I pray not that they may be speedily removed by death." If the 
 world will be vexatious to them, the readiest way to secure them would 
 be to hasten them out of it to a better world, that will give them 
 better treatment. Send chariots and horses of fire for them, to fetch 
 them to heaven; Job, Elijah, Jonah, Moses, when that occurred which 
 fretted them, prayed that they might be <I>taken out of the world;</I> 
 but Christ would not pray so for his disciples, for two reasons:--

 [1.] Because he came to conquer, not to countenance, those intemperate 
 heats and passions which make men impatient of life, and importunate 
 for death. It is his will that we should take up our cross, and not 
 outrun it. 

 [2.] Because he had work for them to do in the world; the world, though 
 sick of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:22">Acts xxii. 22</A>),

 and therefore not worthy of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:38">Heb. xi. 38</A>),

 yet could ill spare them. In pity therefore to this dark world, Christ 
 would not have these lights removed out of it, but continued in it, 
 especially for the sake of those in the world that were to <I>believe 
 in him through their word.</I> Let not them be taken out of the world 
 when their Master is; they must each in his own order die a martyr, but 
 not till they have finished their testimony. Note, <I>First,</I> The 
 taking of good people out of the world is a thing by no means to be 
 desired, but rather dreaded and laid to heart,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:1">Isa. lvii. 1</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Though Christ loves his disciples, he does not
 presently send for them to heaven, as soon as they are effectually 
 called, but leaves them for some time in this world, that they may do 
 good and glorify God upon earth, and be ripened for heaven. Many good 
 people are spared to live, because they can ill be spared to die.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) "I pray not that they may be totally freed and exempted from the 
 troubles of this world, and taken out of the toil and terror of it into 
 some place of ease and safety, there to live undisturbed; this is not 
 the preservation I desire for them." <I>Non ut omni molestia liberati 
 otium et delicias colant, sed ut inter media pericula salvi tamen
 maneant Dei auxilio--Not that, being freed from all trouble, they may
 bask in luxurious ease, but that by the help of God they may be
 preserved in a scene of danger;</I> so Calvin. Not that they may be
 kept from all conflict with the world, but that they may not be
 overcome by it; not that, as Jeremiah wished, they might <I>leave their
 people, and go from them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:2">Jer. ix. 2</A>),

 but that, like Ezekiel, <I>their faces may be strong against the faces 
 of wicked men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:8">Ezek. iii. 8</A>.

 It is more the honour of a Christian soldier by faith to <I>overcome 
 the world</I> than by a monastical vow to retreat from it; and more for 
 the honour of Christ to serve him in a city than to serve him in a 
 cell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Another way is by keeping them from the corruption that is in the 
 world; and he prays they may be thus kept, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11,15"><I>v.</I> 11, 15</A>.

 Here are three branches of this petition:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Holy Father, keep those whom thou hast given me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ was now leaving them; but let them not think that their 
 defence was departed from them; no, he does here, in their hearing, 
 commit them to the custody of his Father and their Father. Note, It is 
 the unspeakable comfort of all believers that Christ himself has 
 committed them to the care of God. Those cannot but be safe whom the 
 almighty God keeps, and he cannot but keep those whom the Son of his 
 love commits to him, in the virtue of which we may by faith <I>commit 
 the keeping of our souls to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:19,2Ti+1:12">1 Pet. iv. 19; 2 Tim. i. 12</A>.
 
 <I>First,</I> He here puts them under the divine protection, that they
 may not be run down by the malice of their enemies; that they and all 
 their concerns may be the particular care of the divine Providence: 
 "<I>Keep</I> their lives, till they have done their work; keep their 
 comforts, and let them not be broken in upon by the hardships they meet 
 with; keep up their interest in the world, and let it not sink." To 
 this prayer is owing the wonderful preservation of the gospel ministry 
 and gospel church in the world unto this day; if God had not graciously 
 kept both, and kept up both, they had been extinguished and lost long 
 ago. <I>Secondly,</I> He puts them under the divine tuition, that they 
 may not themselves run away from their duty, nor be led aside by the 
 treachery of their own hearts: "<I>Keep them</I> in their integrity, 
 keep them disciples, keep them close to their duty." We need God's 
 power not only to put us into a state of grace, but to keep us in it. 
 See,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:28,29,1Pe+1:15"><I>ch.</I> x. 28, 29; 
 1 Pet. i. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The titles he gives to him he prays to, and them he prays for, 
 enforce the petition. <I>First,</I> He speaks to God as a <I>holy 
 Father.</I> In committing ourselves and others to the divine care, we 
 may take encouragement, 

 1. From the attribute of his holiness, for this is engaged for the
 preservation of his holy ones; he hath <I>sworn by his holiness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:35">Ps. lxxxix. 35</A>.

 If he be a holy God and hate sin, he will make those holy that are his, 
 and keep them from sin, which they also hate and dread as the greatest 
 evil. 

 2. From this relation of a Father, wherein he stands to us through
 Christ. If he be a Father, he will take care of his own children, will 
 teach them and keep them; who else should? <I>Secondly,</I> He speaks
 of them as those whom the Father had <I>given him.</I> What we receive 
 as our Father's gifts, we may comfortably remit to our Father's care. 
 "Father, keep the graces and comforts thou hast given me; the children 
 thou hast given me; the ministry <I>I have received.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Keep</I> them <I>through thine own name.</I> That is, 

 [1.] Keep them for thy name's sake; so some. "Thy name and honour are
 concerned in their preservation as well as mine, for both will suffer 
 by it if they either revolt or sink." The Old Testament saints often 
 pleaded, for <I>thy name's sake;</I> and those may with comfort plead 
 it that are indeed more concerned for the honour of God's name than for 
 any interest of their own.

 [2.] Keep them in thy name; so others; the original is so, <B><I>en to
 onomati</I></B>. "Keep them in the knowledge and fear of thy name; keep
 them in the profession and service of thy name, whatever it cost them.
 Keep them in the interest of thy name, and let them ever be faithful to
 this; keep them in thy truths, in thine ordinances, in the way of thy
 commandments." 

 [3.] Keep them by or through thy name; so others. "Keep them by thine 
 own power, in thine own hand; keep them thyself, undertake for them, 
 let them be thine own immediate care. Keep them by those means of
 preservation which thou hast thyself appointed, and by which thou hast 
 made thyself known. Keep them by thy word and ordinances; let thy name 
 be their strong tower, thy tabernacle their pavilion."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) <I>Keep them from the evil,</I> or out of the evil. He had taught 
 them to pray daily, <I>Deliver us from evil,</I> and this would 
 encourage them to pray. 

 [1.] "Keep them from the evil one, the devil and all his instruments; 
 that wicked one and all his children. Keep them from Satan as a 
 tempter, that either he may not have leave to sift them, or that their 
 faith may not fail. Keep them from him as a destroyer, that he may not 
 drive them to despair." 

 [2.] "Keep them from the evil thing, that is sin; from every thing that 
 looks like it, or leads to it. Keep them, that they do no evil,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:7">2 Cor. xiii. 7</A>.

 Sin is that evil which, above any other, we should dread and deprecate. 
 
 [3.] "Keep them from the evil of the world, and of their tribulation in 
 it, so that it may have no sting in it, no malignity;" not that they 
 might be kept from affliction, but kept through it, that the property 
 of their afflictions might be so altered as that there might be no evil 
 in them, nothing to them any harm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons with which he enforces these requests for their 
 preservation, which are five:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He pleads that hitherto he had kept them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>While I was with them in the world, I have kept them in thy 
 name,</I> in the true faith of the gospel and the service of God; those 
 that thou gavest me for my constant attendants I have kept, they are 
 all safe, and none of them missing, none of them revolted nor ruined, 
 <I>but the son of perdition;</I> he is lost, that the scripture might 
 be fulfilled." Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ's faithful discharge of his undertaking concerning his 
 disciples: <I>While he was with them, he kept them,</I> and his care 
 concerning them was not in vain. He kept them in God's name, preserved 
 them from falling into any dangerous errors or sins, from striking in 
 with the Pharisees, who would have <I>compassed sea and land to make 
 proselytes</I> of them; he kept them from deserting him, and returning 
 to the little all they had left for him; he had them still under his 
 eye and care when he sent them to peach; <I>went not his heart with 
 them?</I> Many that followed him awhile took offence at something or 
 other, and went off; but he kept the twelve that they should not go 
 away. He kept them from falling into the hands of persecuting enemies 
 that sought their lives; kept them when he surrendered himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:9"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 9</A>.

 <I>While he was with them</I> he kept them in a visible manner by
 instructions till sounding in their ears, miracles still done before
 their eyes; when he was gone from them, they must be kept in a more
 spiritual manner. Sensible comforts and supports are sometimes given
 and sometimes withheld; but, when they are withdrawn, yet they are not
 left comfortless. What Christ here says of his immediate followers is
 true of all the saints while they are here in this world; Christ keeps
 them <I>in God's name.</I> It is implied, 

 [1.] That they are weak, and cannot keep themselves; their own hands 
 are not sufficient for them.

 [2.] That they are, in God's account, valuable and worth the keeping;
 precious in his sight and honourable; his treasure, his jewels. 

 [3.] That their salvation is designed, for to this it is that they are
 kept,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:5">1 Pet. i. 5</A>.

 As the wicked are reserved for the day of evil, so the righteous are
 preserved for the day of bliss.

 [4.] That they are the charge of the Lord Jesus; for as his charge he 
 keeps them, and exposed himself like the good shepherd for the 
 preservation of the sheep.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The comfortable account he gives of his undertaking: <I>None of 
 them is lost.</I> Note, Jesus Christ will certainly keep all that were 
 given to him, so that none of them shall be totally and finally lost; 
 they may think themselves lost, and may be nearly lost (in imminent 
 peril); but it is the Father's will that he should <I>lose none,</I> 
 and none he will lose 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:39"><I>ch.</I> vi. 39</A>);

 so it will appear when they come all together, and none of them shall
 be wanting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) A brand put upon Judas, as none of those whom he had undertaken to 
 keep. He was among those that were given to Christ, but not of them. He 
 speaks of Judas as already lost, for he had abandoned the society of 
 his Master and his fellow-disciples, and abandoned himself to the 
 devil's guidance, and in a little time would <I>go to his own 
 place;</I> he is as good as lost. But the apostasy and ruin of Judas 
 were no reproach at all to his Master, or his family; for, 

 [1.] He was <I>the son of perdition,</I> and therefore not one of those 
 that were given to Christ to be kept. He deserved perdition, and God 
 left him to throw himself headlong into it. He was the <I>son of the 
 destroyer,</I> as Cain, <I>who was of that wicked one.</I> That great 
 enemy whom the Lord <I>will consume</I> is called a <I>son of 
 perdition,</I> because he is a <I>man of sin,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:3">2 Thess. ii. 3</A>.

 It is an awful consideration that one of the apostles proved a son of
 perdition. No man's place or name in the church, no man's privileges or
 opportunities of getting grace, no man's profession or external
 performances, will secure him from ruin, if his heart be not right with
 God; nor are any more likely to prove sons of perdition at last, after
 a plausible course of profession, than those that like Judas love the
 bag; but Christ's distinguishing Judas from those that were given him
 (for <B><I>ei me</I></B> is adversative, not exceptive) intimates that
 the truth and true religion ought not to suffer for the treachery of
 those that are false to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:19">1 John ii. 19</A>.

 [2.] The scripture was fulfilled; the sin of Judas was foreseen of 
 God's counsel and foretold in his word, and the event would certainly 
 follow after the prediction as a consequent, though it cannot be said 
 necessarily to follow from it as an effect. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:9,69:25,109:8">Ps. xli. 9; lxix. 25; cix. 8</A>.

 We should be amazed at the treachery of apostates, were we not <I>told 
 of it before.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He pleads that he was now under a necessity of leaving them, and 
 could no longer watch over them in the way that he had hitherto done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "Keep them now, that I may not lose the labour I bestowed upon them 
 while I was with them. Keep them, <I>that they may be one</I> with us 
 <I>as we are</I> with each other." We shall have occasion to speak of 
 this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 But see here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) With what pleasure he speaks of his own departure. He expresses 
 himself concerning it with an air of triumph and exultation, with 
 reference both to the world he left and the world he removed to. 

 [1.] "<I>Now I am no more in the world.</I> Now farewell to this 
 provoking troublesome world. I have had enough of it, and now the 
 welcome hour is at hand when I shall be <I>no more in it.</I> Now that 
 I have finished the work I had to do in it, I have done with it; 
 nothing remains now but to hasten out of it as fast as I can." Note, It 
 should be a pleasure to those that have their home in the other world 
 to think of being <I>no more in this world;</I> for when we have done 
 what we have to do in this world, and are made meet for that, what is 
 there here that should court our stay? When we receive a sentence of 
 death within ourselves, with what a holy triumph should we say, "<I>Now 
 I am no more in this world,</I> this dark deceitful world, this poor 
 empty world, this tempting defiling world; no more vexed with its 
 thorns and briars, no more endangered by its nets and snares; now I 
 shall wander no more in this howling wilderness, be tossed no more on 
 this stormy sea; <I>now I am no more in this world,</I> but can 
 cheerfully quit it, and give it a final farewell." 

 [2.] <I>Now I come to thee.</I> To get clear of the world is but the 
 one half of the comfort of a dying Christ, of a dying Christian; the 
 far better half is to think of going to the Father, to sit down in the 
 immediate, uninterrupted, and everlasting enjoyment of him. Note, Those 
 who love God cannot but be pleased to think of coming to him, though it 
 be through the valley of the shadow of death. When we go, to be 
 <I>absent from the body,</I> it is to be <I>present with the Lord,</I> 
 like children fetched home from school to their father's house. "Now 
 come I to thee whom I have chosen and served, and whom my soul 
 thirsteth after; to thee the fountain of light and life, the crown and 
 centre of bliss and joy; now my longings shall be satisfied, my hopes 
 accomplished, my happiness completed, for <I>now come I to 
 thee.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) With what a tender concern he speaks of those whom he left behind: 
 "<I>But these are in the world.</I> I have found what an evil world it 
 is, what will become of these dear little ones that must stay in it? 
 <I>Holy Father, keep them;</I> they will want my presence, let them 
 have thine. They have now more need than ever to be kept, for I am 
 sending them out further into the world than they have yet ventured; 
 they must <I>launch forth into the deep,</I> and have business to do in 
 these great waters, and will be lost if thou do not keep them." Observe 
 here, 

 [1.] That, when our Lord Jesus was going to the Father, he carried with 
 him a tender concern for <I>his own that are in the world;</I> and 
 continued to compassionate them. He bears their names upon his 
 breast-plate, nay, upon his heart, and has <I>graven them</I> with the 
 nails of his cross <I>upon the palms of his hands;</I> and when he is 
 out of their sight they are not out of his, much less out of his mind. 
 We should have such a pity for those that are launching out into the 
 world when we are got almost through it, and for those that are left 
 behind in it when we are leaving it. 

 [2.] That, when Christ would express the utmost need his disciples had 
 of divine preservation, he only says, <I>They are in the world;</I> 
 this bespeaks danger enough to those who are bound for heaven, whom a 
 flattering world would divert and seduce, and a malignant world would 
 hate and persecute.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He pleads what a satisfaction it would be to them to know themselves
 safe, and what a satisfaction it would be to him to see them easy: <I>I
 speak this, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ earnestly desired the fulness of the joy of his disciples, 
 for it is his will that they should rejoice evermore. He was leaving 
 them in tears and troubles, and yet took effectual care to <I>fulfil 
 their joy.</I> When they thought their joy in him was brought to an 
 end, then was it advanced nearer to perfection than ever it had been, 
 and they were fuller of it. We are here taught, 

 [1.] To found our joy in Christ: "It is <I>my joy,</I> joy of my 
 giving, or rather joy that I am the matter of." Christ is a Christian's 
 joy, his chief joy. Joy in the world is withering with it; joy in 
 Christ is everlasting, like him.

 [2.] To build up our joy with diligence; for it is the duty as well as 
 privilege of all true believers; no part of the Christian life is 
 pressed upon us more earnestly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1,4:4">Phil. iii. 1; iv. 4</A>.

 [3.] To aim at the perfection of this joy, that we may have it 
 fulfilled in us, for this Christ would have.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In order hereunto, he did thus solemnly commit them to his
 Father's care and keeping and took them for witnesses that he did so: 
 <I>These things I speak in the world,</I> while I am yet with them in
 the world. His intercession in heaven for their preservation would have 
 been as effectual in itself; but saying this in the world would be a 
 greater satisfaction and encouragement to them, and would enable them 
 to <I>rejoice in tribulation.</I> Note, 

 [1.] Christ has not only treasured up comforts for his people, in 
 providing for their future welfare, but has given out comforts to them, 
 and said that which will be for their present satisfaction. He here 
 condescended in the presence of his disciples to publish his last will 
 and testament, and (which many a testator is shy of) lets them know
 what legacies he had left them, and how well they were secured, that 
 they might have strong consolation. 

 [2.] Christ's intercession for us is enough to fulfil or joy in him; 
 nothing more effectual to silence all our fears and mistrusts, and to 
 furnish us with strong consolation, than this, that he always appears 
 in the presence of God for us; therefore the apostle puts a <I>yea 
 rather</I> upon this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:34">Rom. viii. 34</A>.
 
 And see 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:25">Heb. vii. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He pleads the ill usage they were likely to meet with in the world, 
 for his sake 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>I have given them thy word</I> to be published to the world, <I>and 
 they have received it,</I> have believed it themselves, and accepted 
 the trust of transmitting it to the world; and therefore <I>the world 
 hath hated them,</I> as also because they are <I>not of the world,</I> 
 any more than I." Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The world's enmity to Christ's followers. While Christ was with 
 them, though as yet they had given but little opposition to the world, 
 yet it hates them, much more would it do so when by their more 
 extensive preaching of the gospel they would <I>turn the world upside 
 down.</I> "Father, stand their friend," says Christ, "for they are 
 likely to have many enemies; let them have thy love, for the world's 
 hatred is entailed upon them. In the midst of those fiery darts, let 
 them be <I>compassed with thy favour as with a shield.</I>" It is God's 
 honour to take part with the weaker side, and to help the helpless. 
 <I>Lord, be merciful to them, for men would swallow</I> them up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The reasons of this enmity, which strengthen the plea. 

 [1.] It is implied that one reason is because they had received the 
 word of God as it was sent them by the hand of Christ, when the 
 greatest part of the world rejected it, and set themselves against 
 those who were the preachers and professors of it. Note, Those that 
 receive Christ's good will and good word must expect the world's ill 
 will and ill word. Gospel ministers have been in a particular manner
 hated by the world, because they call men out of the world, and 
 separate them from it, and teach them not to conform to it, and so 
 condemn the world. "<I>Father, keep them</I> for it is for thy sake 
 that they are exposed; they are sufferers for thee." Thus the psalmist
 pleads, <I>For thy sake I have borne reproach,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:7">Ps. lxix. 7</A>.

 Note, Those that keep the word of Christ's patience are entitled to
 special protection in the hour of temptation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:10">Rev. iii. 10</A>.

 That cause which makes a martyr may well make a joyful sufferer. 

 [2.] Another reason is more express; the world hates them, because they 
 <I>are not of the world.</I> Those to whom the word of Christ comes in 
 power are not of the world, for it has this effect upon all that 
 receive it in the love of it that it weans them from the wealth of the 
 world, and turns them against the wickedness of the world, and 
 therefore the world bears them a grudge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He pleads their conformity to himself in a holy non-conformity to 
 the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "Father, keep them, for they are of my spirit and mind, <I>they are not 
 of the world, even as I am not of the world.</I>" Those may in faith 
 commit themselves to God's custody, 

 (1.) Who are <I>as Christ was in this world,</I> and tread in his 
 steps. God will love those that are like Christ. 

 (2.) Who do not engage themselves in the world's interest, nor devote 
 themselves to its service. Observe, 

 [1.] That Jesus Christ was not of this world; he never had been of it, 
 and least of all now that he was upon the point of leaving it. This 
 intimates, <I>First,</I> His state; he was none of the world's 
 favourites nor darlings, none of its princes nor grandees; worldly 
 possessions he had none, not even <I>where to lay his head;</I> nor 
 worldly power, he was no judge nor divider. <I>Secondly,</I> His
 Spirit; he was perfectly dead to the world, the prince of this world 
 had nothing in him, the things of this world were nothing to him; not 
 honour, for he <I>made himself of no reputation;</I> not riches, for 
 <I>for our sakes he became poor;</I> not pleasures, for he 
 <I>acquainted himself with grief.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:23"><I>ch.</I> viii. 23</A>.

 [2.] That therefore true Christians are not of this world. The Spirit 
 of Christ in them is opposite to the spirit of the world. <I>First,</I> 
 It is their lot to be despised by the world; they are not in favour 
 with the world any more than their Master before them was. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> It is their privilege to be delivered from the world; 
 as Abraham out of the land of his nativity. <I>Thirdly,</I> It is their 
 duty and character to be dead to the world. Their most pleasing 
 converse is, and should be, with another world, and their prevailing 
 concern about the business of that world, not of this. Christ's 
 disciples were weak, and had many infirmities; yet this he could say 
 for them, They were not of the world, not of the earth, and therefore 
 he recommends them to the care of Heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
 &nbsp; 18  As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also
 sent them into the world.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The next thing he prayed for for them was that they might be 
 sanctified; not only kept from evil, but made good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the petition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Sanctify them through thy truth,</I> through thy word, for <I>thy 
 word is truth;</I> it is true--it is truth itself. He desires they may 
 be sanctified,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As Christians. Father, make them holy, and this will be their 
 preservation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:23">1 Thess. v. 23</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The grace desired--sanctification. The disciples were sanctified,
 for they were not of the world; yet he prays, <I>Father sanctify 
 them,</I> that is, 

 [1.] "Confirm the work of sanctification in them, strengthen their 
 faith, inflame their good affections, rivet their good resolutions." 
 
 [2.] "Carry on that good work in them, and continue it; let the 
 <I>light shine more and more.</I>" 

 [3.] "Complete it, crown it with the perfection of holiness; sanctify 
 them throughout and to the end." Note, <I>First,</I> It is the prayer 
 of Christ for all that are his that they may be sanctified; because he 
 cannot for shame own them as his, either here or hereafter, either 
 employ them in his work or present them to his Father, if they be not 
 sanctified. <I>Secondly,</I> Those that through grace are sanctified
 have need to be sanctified more and more. Even disciples must pray for
 sanctifying grace; for, if he that was the author of the good work be 
 not the finisher of it, we are undone. Not to go forward is to go 
 backward; <I>he that is holy must be holy still,</I> more holy still, 
 pressing forward, soaring upward, as those that have not attained.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> It is God that sanctifies as well as God that 
 justified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:5">2 Cor. v. 5</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> It is an encouragement to us, in our prayers for 
 sanctifying grace, that it is what Christ intercedes for for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The means of conferring this grace--<I>through thy truth, thy word
 is truth.</I> Not that the Holy One of Israel is hereby limited to 
 means, but in the <I>counsel of peace</I> among other things it was
 settled and agreed, 

 [1.] That all needful truth should be comprised and summed up in the 
 word of God. Divine revelation, as it now stands in the written word, 
 is not only pure truth without mixture, but entire truth without 
 deficiency. 

 [2.] That this word of truth should be the outward and ordinary means 
 of our sanctification; not of itself, for then it would always 
 sanctify, but as the instrument which the Spirit commonly uses in 
 beginning and carrying on that good work; it is the seed of the new 
 birth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:23">1 Pet. i. 23</A>),

 and the food of the new life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:1,2">1 Pet. ii. 1-2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As ministers. "<I>Sanctify them,</I> set them apart for thyself and 
 service; let their call to the apostleship be ratified in heaven." 
 Prophets were said to be sanctified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:5">Jer. i. 5</A>.

 Priests and Levites were so. <I>Sanctify them;</I> that is,

 (1.) "Qualify them for the office, with Christian graces and 
 ministerial gifts, to make them able ministers of the New Testament." 
 
 (2.) "Separate them to the office,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:1">Rom. i. 1</A>.

 I have called them, they have consented; Father, say <I>Amen</I> to
 it." 

 (3.) "Own them in the office; let thy hand go along with them; sanctify 
 them by or in thy truth, as truth is opposed to figure and shadow; 
 sanctify them really, not ritually and ceremonially, as the Levitical 
 priests were, by anointing and sacrifice. Sanctify them to thy truth, 
 the word of thy truth, to be the preachers of thy truth to the world; 
 as the priests were sanctified to serve at the altar, so let them be to 
 preach the gospel."

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:13,14">1 Cor. ix. 13, 14</A>.
 
 Note, 

 [1.] Jesus Christ intercedes for his ministers with a particular 
 concern, and recommends to his Father's grace those stars he carries in 
 his right hand. 

 [2.] The great thing to be asked of God for gospel ministers is that 
 they may be sanctified, effectually separated from the world, entirely 
 devoted to God, and experimentally acquainted with the influence of 
 that word upon their own hearts which they preach to others. Let them 
 have the <I>Urim</I> and <I>Thummim, light</I> and 
 <I>integrity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have here two pleas or arguments to enforce the petition for the 
 disciples' sanctification:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The mission they had from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>As thou hast sent me into the world,</I> to be thine ambassador to 
 the children of men, so now that I am recalled <I>have I sent them into 
 the world,</I> as my delegates." Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ speaks with great assurance of his own mission: <I>Thou 
 hast sent me into the world.</I> The great author of the Christian 
 religion had his commission and instructions from him who is the origin 
 and object of all religion. He was sent of God to say what he said, and 
 do what he did, and be what he is to those that believe on him; which 
 was his comfort in his undertaking, and may be ours abundantly in our 
 dependence upon him; his record was on high, for thence his mission 
 was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He speaks with great satisfaction of the commission he had given 
 his disciples "<I>So have I sent them</I> on the same errand, and to 
 carry on the same design;" to preach the same doctrine that he 
 preached, and to confirm it with the same proofs, with a charge 
 likewise to commit to other faithful men that which was committed to 
 them. He gave them their commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:21"><I>ch.</I> xx. 21</A>)

 with a reference to his own, and it magnifies their office that it
 comes from Christ, and that there is some affinity between the 
 commission given to the ministers of reconciliation and that given to 
 the Mediator; he is called an <I>apostle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:1">Heb. iii. 1</A>),

 a <I>minister</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:8">Rom. xv. 8</A>),
 
 a <I>messenger,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>.

 Only they are sent as servants, he as a Son. Now this comes in here as
 a reason, 

 [1.] Why Christ was concerned so much for them, and laid their case so 
 near his heart; because he had himself put them into a difficult 
 office, which required great abilities for the due discharge of it. 
 Note, Whom Christ sends he will stand by, and interest himself in those 
 that are employed for him; what he calls us out to he will fit us out 
 for, and bear us up in. 

 [2.] Why he committed them to his Father; because he was concerned in 
 their cause, their mission being in prosecution of his, and as it were 
 an assignment out of it. Christ <I>received gifts for men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>),
 
 and then gave them to men
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8">Eph. iv. 8</A>),

 and therefore <I>prays aid</I> of his Father to warrant and uphold 
 those gifts, and confirm his grant of them. The Father <I>sanctified 
 him</I> when <I>he sent him into the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:36"><I>ch.</I> x. 36</A>.
 
 Now, they being sent as he was, let them also be sanctified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The merit he had for them is another thing here pleaded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>For their sakes I sanctify myself.</I> Here is, 

 (1.) Christ's designation of himself to the work and office of 
 Mediator: <I>I sanctified myself.</I> He entirely devoted himself to 
 the undertaking, and all the parts of it, especially that which he was 
 now going about--the <I>offering up of himself without spot unto God, 
 by the eternal Spirit.</I> He, as the priest and altar, sanctified 
 himself as the sacrifice. When he said, Father, <I>glorify thy 
 name</I>--Father, <I>thy will be done</I>--Father, I <I>commit my 
 spirit into thy hands,</I> he paid down the satisfaction he had engaged 
 to make, and so sanctified himself. This he pleads with his Father, for 
 his intercession is made in the virtue of his satisfaction; <I>by his 
 own blood he entered into the holy place</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:12">Heb. ix. 12</A>),

 as the high priest, on the day of atonement, sprinkled the blood of the 
 sacrifice at the same time that he burnt incense within the veil,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:12,14">Lev. xvi. 12, 14</A>.
 
 (2.) Christ's design of kindness to his disciples herein; it is <I>for
 their sakes,</I> that <I>they may be sanctified,</I> that is, that they
 may be martyrs; so some. "I sacrifice myself, that they may be
 sacrificed to the glory of God and the church's good." Paul speaks of
 his being offered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:17,2Ti+4:6">Phil. ii. 17; 2 Tim. iv. 6</A>.

 Whatever there is in the <I>death of the saints</I> that is <I>precious
 in the sight of the Lord,</I> it is owing to the death of the Lord 
 Jesus. But I rather take it more generally, that they may be saints and 
 ministers, duly qualified and accepted of God. 

 [1.] The office of the ministry is the purchase of Christ's blood, and 
 one of the blessed fruits of his satisfaction, and owes its virtue and 
 value to Christ's merit. The priests under the law were consecrated 
 with the blood of bulls and goats, but gospel ministers with the blood 
 of Jesus. 

 [2.] The real holiness of all good Christians is the fruit of Christ's 
 death, by which the gift of the Holy Ghost was purchased; he <I>gave 
 himself for his church,</I> to <I>sanctify it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:25,26">Eph. v. 25, 26</A>.

 And he that designed the end designed also the means, that they might
 be sanctified <I>by the truth,</I> the truth which Christ came into the 
 world to bear witness to and died to confirm. The word of truth 
 receives its sanctifying virtue and power from the death of Christ.
 Some read it, that they may be sanctified <I>in truth,</I> that is, 
 truly; for as God must be served, so, in order to this, we must be 
 sanctified, <I>in the spirit, and in truth.</I> And this Christ has 
 prayed for, for all that are his; for <I>this is his will, even their 
 sanctification,</I> which encourages them to pray for it,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which
 shall believe on me through their word;
 &nbsp; 21  That they all may be one; as thou, Father, <I>art</I> in me, and
 I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may
 believe that thou hast sent me.
 &nbsp; 22  And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that
 they may be one, even as we are one:
 &nbsp; 23  I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in
 one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast
 loved them, as thou hast loved me.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Next to their purity he prays for their unity; for the wisdom from 
 above is <I>first pure, then peaceable;</I> and amity is amiable indeed 
 when it is like the ointment on Aaron's holy head, and the dew on 
 Zion's holy hill. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who are included in this prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Not these only,</I> not these only that are now my disciples" (the
 eleven, the seventy, with others, men and women that followed him when 
 he was here on earth), "but <I>for those also who shall believe on me 
 through their word,</I> either preached by them in their own day or 
 written by them for the generations to come; I pray <I>for them 
 all,</I> that they all may be one in their interest in this prayer, and 
 may all receive benefit by it." Note, here, 

 1. Those, and those only, are interested in the mediation of Christ,
 that do, or shall, believe in him. This is that by which they are 
 described, and it comprehends all the character and duty of a 
 Christian. They that lived then, <I>saw and believed,</I> but they in 
 after ages <I>have not seen,</I> and yet <I>have believed.</I> 

 2. It is <I>through the word</I> that souls are brought to believe on
 Christ, and it is for this end that Christ appointed the scriptures to 
 be written, and a standing ministry to continue in the church, while 
 the church stands, that is, while the world stands, for the raising up 
 of a seed. 

 3. It is certainly and infallibly known to Christ who shall believe on
 him. He does not here pray at a venture, upon a contingency depending 
 on the treacherous will of man, which pretends to be free, but by 
 reason of sin is <I>in bondage with its children;</I> no, Christ knew 
 very well whom he prayed for, the matter was reduced to a certainty by 
 the divine prescience and purpose; he knew who were given him, who 
 being ordained to eternal life, were <I>entered in the Lamb's book,</I> 
 and should undoubtedly believe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:48">Acts xiii. 48</A>.

 4. Jesus Christ intercedes not only for great and eminent believers,
 but for the meanest and weakest; not for those only that are to be 
 employed in the highest post of trust and honour in his kingdom, but 
 for all, even those that in the eye of the world are inconsiderable. As 
 the divine providence extends itself to the meanest creature, so does 
 the divine grace to the meanest Christian. The good Shepherd has an eye 
 even to <I>the poor of the flock.</I> 

 5. Jesus Christ in his mediation had an actual regard to those of the
 chosen remnant that were yet unborn, the people that <I>should be 
 created</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:31">Ps. xxii. 31</A>),

 the <I>other sheep</I> which he <I>must yet bring.</I> Before they are 
 <I>formed in the womb he knows them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:5">Jer. i. 5</A>),

 and prayers are filed in heaven for them beforehand, by him who 
 <I>declareth the end from the beginning, and calleth things that are 
 not as though they were.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What is intended in this prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>That they all may be one.</I> The same was said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 <I>that they may be one as we are,</I> and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The heart of Christ was much upon this. Some think that the oneness
 prayed for in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>

 has special reference to the disciples as ministers and apostles, that 
 they might be one in their testimony to Christ; and that the harmony of 
 the evangelists, and concurrence of the first preachers of the gospel, 
 are owing to this prayer. Let them be not only of <I>one heart,</I> but 
 of <I>one mouth,</I> speaking the same thing. The unity of the gospel
 ministers is both the beauty and strength of the gospel interest. But 
 it is certain that the oneness prayed for in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>

 respects all believers. It is the prayer of Christ for all that are 
 his, and we may be sure it is an answered prayer--<I>that they all may 
 be one,</I> one in us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 one <I>as e are one</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 made <I>perfect in one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 It includes three things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they might all be <I>incorporated in one body.</I> "Father, 
 look upon them all as one, and ratify that great charter by which they
 are embodied as one church. Though they live in distant places, from
 one end of heaven to the other, and in several ages, from the beginning
 to the close of time, and so cannot have any personal acquaintance or
 correspondence with each other, yet let them be united in me their
 common head." As Christ died, so he prayed, to <I>gather them all in
 one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52,Eph+1:10"><I>ch.</I> xi. 52; Eph. i. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they might all be animated by one Spirit. This is plainly 
 implied in this--<I>that they may be one in us.</I> Union with the
 Father and Son is obtained and kept up only by the Holy Ghost. <I>He 
 that is joined to the Lord in one spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:17">1 Cor. vi. 17</A>.

 Let them all be stamped with the same image and superscription, and 
 influenced by the same power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That they might all be <I>knit together</I> in the bond of love and 
 charity, all of one heart. <I>That they all may be one,</I> 

 (1.) In judgment and sentiment; not in every little thing--this is 
 neither possible nor needful, but in the great things of God, and in 
 them, by the virtue of this prayer, they are all agreed--that God's 
 favour is better than life--that sin is the worst of evils, Christ the
 best of friends--that there is another life after this, and the like.
 
 (2.) In disposition and inclination. All that are sanctified have the
 same divine nature and image; they have all a new heart, and it is 
 <I>one heart.</I> 

 (3.) They are all one in their designs and aims. Every true Christian,
 <I>as far as he is so,</I> eyes the glory of God as his highest end, 
 and the glory of heaven as his chief good. 

 (4.) They are all one in their desires and prayers; though they differ 
 in words and the manner of expressions, yet, having received the same 
 <I>spirit of adoption,</I> and observing the same rule, they pray for 
 the same things in effect. 

 (5.) All one in love and affection. Every true Christian has that in 
 him which inclines him to love all true Christians as such. That which 
 Christ here prays for is that <I>communion of saints</I> which we 
 profess to believe; the fellowship which all believers have with God, 
 and their intimate union with all the saints in heaven and earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3">1 John i. 3</A>.

 But this prayer of Christ will not have its complete answer till all
 the saints come to heaven, for then, and not till then, they shall be 
 <I>perfect in one,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:23,Eph+4:13"><I>v.</I> 23; Eph. iv. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What is intimated by way of plea or argument to enforce this 
 petition; three things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The oneness that is between the Father and the Son, which is 
 mentioned again and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11,21-23"><I>v.</I> 11, 21-23</A>.

 (1.) It is taken for granted that the Father and Son are one, one in 
 nature and essence, equal in power and glory, one in mutual 
 endearments. The <I>Father loveth the Son,</I> and the Son always 
 pleased the Father. They are one in design, and one in operation. The 
 intimacy of this oneness is expressed in these words, <I>thou in me, 
 and I in thee.</I> This he often mentions for his support under his 
 present sufferings, when his enemies were ready to fall upon him, and 
 his friends to fall off from him; yet he was in the Father, and the 
 Father in him. 

 (2.) This is insisted on in Christ's prayer for his disciples' oneness,
 
 [1.] As the pattern of that oneness, showing how he desired they might 
 be one. Believers are one in some measure as God and Christ are one; 
 for, <I>First,</I> The union of believers is a strict and close union; 
 they are united by a divine nature, by the power of divine grace, in 
 pursuance of the divine counsels. <I>Secondly,</I> It is a holy union, 
 in the Holy Spirit, for holy ends; not a body politic for any secular 
 purpose. <I>Thirdly,</I> It is, and will be at last, a complete union. 
 Father and Son have the same attributes, properties, and perfections; 
 so have believers now, as far as they are sanctified, and when grace 
 shall be perfected in glory they will be exactly consonant to each 
 other, all changed into the same image. 

 [2.] As the centre of that oneness; that they may be <I>one in us,</I> 
 all meeting here. There is <I>one God</I> and <I>one Mediator;</I> and 
 herein believers are one, that they all agree to depend upon the favour 
 of this one God as their felicity and the merit of this one Mediator as 
 their righteousness. That is a conspiracy, not a union, which doth not
 centre in God as the end, and Christ as the way. All who are truly 
 united to God and Christ, who <I>are one,</I> will soon be <I>united 
 one to another.</I> 

 [3.] As a plea for that oneness. The Creator and Redeemer are one in 
 interest and design; but to what purpose are they so, if all believers 
 be not one body with Christ, and do not jointly receive grace for grace 
 from him, as he has received it for them? Christ's design was to
 reduce revolted mankind to God: "Father," says he, "let all that 
 believe be one, that <I>in one body</I> they may be reconciled"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:15,16">Eph. ii. 15, 16</A>),
 
 which speaks of the uniting of Jews and Gentiles in the church; that 
 great mystery, that the Gentiles should be <I>fellow-heirs, and of the 
 same body</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:6">Eph. iii. 6</A>),

 to which I think this prayer of Christ principally refers, it being one 
 great thing he aimed at in his dying; and I wonder none of the 
 expositors I have met with should so apply it. "Father, let the
 Gentiles that believe be incorporated with the believing Jews, and 
 <I>make of twain one new man.</I>" Those words, <I>I in them, and thou 
 in me,</I> show what that union is which is so necessary, not only to 
 the beauty, but to the very being, of his church. <I>First,</I> Union 
 with Christ: <I>I in them.</I> Christ dwelling in the hearts of 
 believers is the life and soul of the new man. <I>Secondly,</I> Union 
 with God through him: <I>Thou in me,</I> so as by me to be in them.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Union with each other, resulting from these: <I>that 
 they</I> hereby <I>may be made perfect in one.</I> We are complete in 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The design of Christ in all his communications of light and grace to 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>The glory which thou gavest me,</I> as the trustee or channel of 
 conveyance, <I>I have</I> accordingly <I>given them,</I> to this 
 intent, <I>that they may be one, as we are one;</I> so that those gifts 
 will be in vain, if they be not one." Now these gifts are either, 

 (1.) Those that were conferred upon the apostles, and first planters of 
 the church. The glory of being God's ambassadors to the world--the 
 glory of working miracles--the glory of gathering a church out of the 
 world, and erecting the throne of God's kingdom among men--this glory 
 was given to Christ, and some of the honour he put upon them when he 
 sent them to <I>disciple all nations.</I> Or, 

 (2.) Those that are given in common to all believers. The glory of 
 being in covenant with the Father, and accepted of him, of being laid 
 in his bosom, and designed for a place at his right hand, was the glory 
 which the Father gave to the Redeemer, and he has confirmed it to the 
 redeemed. 

 [1.] This honour he says he <I>hath given them,</I> because he hath 
 intended it for them, settled it upon them, and secured it to them upon 
 their believing Christ's promises to be real gifts. 

 [2.] This was given to him to give to them; it was conveyed to him in 
 trust for them, and he was faithful to him that appointed him. 

 [3.] He gave it to them, that they <I>might be one.</I> <I>First,</I> 
 to entitle them to the privilege of unity, that by virtue of their 
 common relation to <I>one God the Father,</I> and <I>one Lord Jesus 
 Christ,</I> they might be truly denominated one. The gift of the
 Spirit, that great glory which the Father gave to the Son, by him to be 
 given to all believers, makes them one, for he works <I>all in all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:4">1 Cor. xii. 4</A>,

 &c. <I>Secondly,</I> To engage them to the duty of unity. That in 
 consideration of their agreement and communion in one creed and one 
 covenant, one Spirit and one Bible--in consideration of what they have
 in one God and one Christ, and of what they hope for in one heaven, 
 they may be of one mind and one mouth. Worldly glory sets men at
 variance; for if some be advanced others are eclipsed, and therefore, 
 while the disciples dreamed of a temporal kingdom, they were ever and 
 anon quarrelling; but spiritual honours being conferred alike upon all 
 Christ's subjects, they being all <I>made to our God kings and 
 priests,</I> there is no occasion for contest nor emulation. The more 
 Christians are taken up with the glory Christ has given them, the less 
 desirous they will be of vain-glory, and, consequently, the less 
 disposed to quarrel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He pleads the happy influence their oneness would have upon others, 
 and the furtherance it would give to the public good. This is twice 
 urged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>That the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</I> And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>That the world may know it,</I> for without knowledge there can be 
 no true faith. Believers must know what they believe, and why and 
 wherefore they believe it. Those who believe <I>at a venture,</I> 
 venture too far. Now Christ here shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His good-will to the world of mankind in general. Herein he is of 
 his Father's mind, as we are sure he is in every thing, that he would 
 have all men to be saved, and to <I>come to the knowledge of the 
 truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:4,2Pe+3:9">1 Tim. ii. 4; 2 Pet. iii. 9</A>.

 Therefore it is his will that all means possible should be used, and no 
 stone left unturned, for the conviction and conversion of the world. We 
 know not who are chosen, but we must in our places do our utmost to 
 further men's salvation, and take heed of doing any thing to hinder 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The good fruit of the church's oneness; it will be an evidence of 
 the truth of Christianity, and a means of bringing many to embrace 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] In general, it will recommend Christianity to the world, and to 
 the good opinion of those that are without. <I>First,</I> The embodying 
 of Christians in one society by the gospel charter will greatly promote 
 Christianity. When the world shall see so many of those that were its 
 children called out of its family, distinguished from others, and 
 changed from what they themselves sometimes were,--when they shall see
 this society raised by the foolishness of preaching, and kept up by 
 miracles of divine providence and grace, and how admirably well it is
 modelled and constituted, they will be ready to say, <I>We will go with
 you, for we see that God is with you. Secondly,</I> The uniting of
 Christians in love and charity is the beauty of their profession, and
 invites others to join with them, as the love that was among those
 primo-primitive Christians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:42,43,4:32,33">Acts ii. 42, 43; iv. 32, 33</A>.

 When Christianity, instead of causing quarrels about itself, makes all 
 other strifes to cease,--when it cools the fiery, smooths the rugged,
 and disposes men to be kind and loving, courteous and beneficent, to 
 all men, studious to preserve and promote peace in all relations and 
 societies, this will recommend it to all that have any thing either of 
 natural religion or natural affection in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] In particular, it will beget in men good thoughts, <I>First,</I> 
 Of Christ: They will know and believe that <I>thou hast sent me,</I> By 
 this it will appear that Christ was sent of God, and that his doctrine 
 was divine, in that his religion prevails to join so many of different 
 capacities, tempers, and interests in other things, in one body by 
 faith, with one heart by love. Certainly he was sent by the God of 
 power, who fashions men's hearts alike, and the God of love and peace; 
 when the worshippers of God are one, he is one, and his name one. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Of Christians: They will <I>know that thou hast loved 
 them as thou hast loved me.</I> Here is, 

 1. The privilege of believers: <I>the Father</I> himself loveth them
 with a love resembling his love to his Son, for they are loved in him 
 with an everlasting love. 

 2. The evidence of their interest in this privilege, and that is their
 being one. By this it will appear that God loves us, if we <I>love one 
 another with a pure heart;</I> for wherever <I>the love of God is shed 
 abroad in the heart</I> it will change it into the same image. See how 
 much good it would do to the world to know better how dear to God all 
 good Christians are. The Jews had a saying, <I>If the world did but 
 know the worth of good men, they would hedge them about with 
 pearls.</I> Those that have so much of God's love should have more of 
 ours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be
 with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou
 hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the
 world.
 &nbsp; 25  O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I
 have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
 &nbsp; 26  And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare
 <I>it:</I> that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A petition for the glorifying of all those that were given to Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 not only these apostles, but all believers: <I>Father, I will that they 
 may be with me.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The connection of this request with those foregoing. He had prayed 
 that God would preserve, sanctify, and unite them; and now he prays 
 that he would crown all his gifts with their glorification. In this 
 method we must pray, first for grace, and then for glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:11">Ps. lxxxiv. 11</A>);
 
 for in this method God gives. Far be it from the only wise God to come 
 under the imputation either of that <I>foolish builder who without a 
 foundation built upon the sand,</I> as he would if he should glorify 
 any whom he has not first sanctified; or of that <I>foolish builder who 
 began to build and was not able to finish,</I> as he would if he should 
 sanctify any, and not glorify them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The manner of the request: <I>Father, I will.</I> Here, as before, 
 he addresses himself to God as a Father, and therein we must do 
 likewise; but when he says, <B><I>thelo</I></B>--<I>I will,</I> he
 speaks a language peculiar to himself, and such as does not become 
 ordinary petitioners, but very well became him who paid for what he 
 prayed for. 

 (1.) This intimates the authority of his intercession in general; his 
 word was with power in heaven, as well as on earth. He entering <I>with 
 his own blood into the holy place,</I> his intercession there has an 
 uncontrollable efficacy. He intercedes as a king, for he is a priest 
 upon his throne (like Melchizedek), a king-priest. 

 (2.) It intimates his particular authority in this matter; he had a 
 power to <I>give eternal life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and, pursuant to that power, he says, <I>Father, I will.</I> Though now 
 he <I>took upon him the form of a servant,</I> yet that power being to 
 be most illustriously exerted when he shall come the second time in the 
 glory of a judge, to say, <I>Come ye blessed,</I> having that in his 
 eye, he might well say, <I>Father, I will.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The request itself--that all the elect might come to be with him in
 heaven at last, to see his glory, and to share in it. Now observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Under what notion we are to hope for heaven? wherein does that 
 happiness consist? three things make heaven:--

 [1.] It is to be where Christ is: <I>Where I am;</I> in the paradise 
 whither Christ's soul went at death; in the third heavens whither his 
 soul and body went at his ascension:--<I>Where I am,</I> am to be 
 shortly, am to be eternally. In this world we are but <I>in
 transitu--on our passage;</I> there we truly are where we are to be for 
 ever; so Christ reckoned, and so must we. 

 [2.] It is to be with him where he is; this is not tautology, but 
 intimates that we shall not only be in the same happy place where 
 Christ is, but that the happiness of the place will consist in his 
 presence; this is <I>the fulness of its joy.</I> The very heaven of 
 heaven is to be with Christ, there in company with him, and communion 
 with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:23">Phil. i. 23</A>.

 [3.] It is to <I>behold his glory, which the Father</I> has given him.
 Observe, <I>First,</I> The glory of the Redeemer is the brightness of
 heaven. That glory before which angels cover their faces was his glory,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:41"><I>ch.</I> xii. 41</A>.
 
 The Lamb is the light of the new Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:23">Rev. xxi. 23</A>.

 Christ will <I>come in the glory of his Father,</I> for <I>he is the 
 brightness of his glory.</I> God shows his glory there, as he does his 
 grace here, through Christ. "<I>The Father has given me this 
 glory,</I>" though he was as yet in his low estate; but it was very 
 true, and very near. <I>Secondly,</I> The felicity of the redeemed 
 consists very much in the beholding of this glory; they will have the 
 immediate view of his glorious person. <I>I shall see God in my 
 flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:26,27">Job xix. 26, 27</A>.

 They will have a clear insight into his glorious undertaking, as it
 will be then accomplished; they will see into those springs of love 
 from which flow all the streams of grace; they shall have an 
 appropriating sight of Christ's glory (<I>Uxor fulget radiis mariti--The
 wife shines with the radiance of her husband</I>), and an assimilating 
 sight: they shall <I>be changed into the same image, from glory to 
 glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Upon what ground we are to hope for heaven; no other than purely 
 the mediation and intercession of Christ, because he hath said, 
 <I>Father, I will.</I> Our sanctification is our evidence, for <I>he 
 that has this hope in him purifies himself;</I> but it is the will of 
 Christ that is our title, <I>by which will we are sanctified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:10">Heb. x. 10</A>.

 Christ speaks here as if he did not count his own happiness complete
 unless he had his elect to share with him in it, for it is <I>the 
 bringing of many sons to glory that makes the captain of our salvation 
 perfect,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The argument to back this request: <I>for thou lovedst me before the 
 foundation of the world.</I> This is a reason, 

 (1.) Why he expected this glory himself. Thou wilt <I>give it to me, 
 for thou lovedst me.</I> The honour and power given to the Son as 
 Mediator were founded in the Father's love to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:20"><I>ch.</I> v. 20</A>):

 <I>the Father loves the Son,</I> is infinitely well pleased in his 
 undertaking, and <I>therefore has given all things into his hands;</I> 
 and, the matter being concerted in the divine counsels from eternity, 
 he is said to love him as Mediator <I>before the foundation of the
 world.</I> Or,

 (2.) Why he expected that those who <I>were given to him</I> should be
 with him to share in his glory: "<I>Thou lovedst me,</I> and them in 
 me, and canst deny me nothing I ask for them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The conclusion of the prayer, which is designed to enforce all the 
 petitions for the disciples, especially the last, that they may be 
 glorified. Two things he insists upon, and pleads:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The respect he had to his Father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The title he gives to God: <I>O righteous Father.</I> When he 
 prayed that they might be sanctified, he called him <I>holy Father;</I> 
 when he prays that they may be glorified, he calls him <I>righteous 
 Father;</I> for it is a <I>crown of righteousness which the righteous 
 Judge shall give.</I> God's righteousness was engaged for the giving 
 out of all that good which the Father had promised and the Son had 
 purchased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The character he gives of the world that lay in wickedness: <I>The 
 world has not known thee.</I> Note, Ignorance of God overspreads the 
 world of mankind; this is the darkness they sit in. Now this is urged 
 here, 

 [1.] To show that these disciples need the aids of special grace, both 
 because of the necessity of their work--they were to bring a world that 
 knew not God to the knowledge of him; and also, because of the 
 difficulty of their work--they must bring light to those that rebelled 
 against the light; therefore keep them. 

 [2.] To show that they were qualified for further peculiar favours, for 
 they had that knowledge of God which the world had not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The plea he insists upon for himself: <I>But I have known 
 thee.</I> Christ knew the Father as no one else ever did; knew upon 
 what grounds he went in his undertaking, knew his Father's mind in 
 every thing, and therefore, in this prayer, came to him with 
 confidence, as we do to one we know. Christ is here suing out blessings 
 for those that were his; pursuing this petition, when he had said, 
 <I>The world has not known thee,</I> one would expect it should follow, 
 <I>but they have known thee;</I> no, their knowledge was not to be 
 boasted of, <I>but I have known thee,</I> which intimates that there is 
 nothing in us to recommend us to God's favour, but all our interest in 
 him, and intercourse with him, result from, and depend upon, Christ's 
 interest and intercourse. We are unworthy, but he is worthy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The plea he insists upon for his disciples: <I>And they have known 
 that thou hast sent me;</I> and, 

 [1.] Hereby they are distinguished from the unbelieving world. When 
 multitudes to whom Christ was sent, and his grace offered, would not 
 <I>believe that God had sent him,</I> these knew it, and believed it, 
 and were not ashamed to own it. Note, To know and believe in Jesus 
 Christ, in the midst of a world that persists in ignorance and 
 infidelity, is highly pleasing to God, and shall certainly be crowned 
 with distinguishing glory. Singular faith qualifies for singular 
 favours. 

 [2.] Hereby they are interested in the mediation of Christ, and partake 
 of the benefit of his acquaintance with the Father: "<I>I have known 
 thee,</I> immediately and perfectly; and these, though they have not so 
 known thee, nor were capable of knowing thee so, yet <I>have known that 
 thou hast sent me,</I> have known that which was required of them to 
 know, have known the Creator in the Redeemer." Knowing Christ as sent 
 of God, they have, in him, known the Father, and are introduced to an 
 acquaintance with him; therefore, "Father, look after them for my 
 sake."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The respect he had to his disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "I have led them into the knowledge of thee, and will do it yet more 
 and more; with this great and kind intention, <I>that the love 
 wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</I>" 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What Christ had done for them: <I>I have declared unto them thy
 name.</I> 

 [1.] This he had done for those that were his immediate followers. 
 <I>All the time that he went in and out among them,</I> he made it his 
 business to declare his Father's name to them, and to beget in them a 
 veneration for it. The tendency of all his sermons and miracles was to 
 advance his Father's honours, and to spread the knowledge of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>.

 [2.] This he had done for all that believe on him; for they had not 
 been brought to believe if Christ had not made known to them his 
 Father's name. Note, <I>First,</I> We are indebted to Christ for all 
 the knowledge we have of the Father's name; he declares it, and he 
 opens the understanding to receive that revelation. <I>Secondly,</I>
 Those whom Christ recommends to the favour of God he first leads into 
 an acquaintance with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he intended to do yet further for them: <I>I will declare 
 it.</I> To the disciples he designed to give further instructions after 
 his resurrection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:3">Acts i. 3</A>),

 and to bring them into a much more intimate acquaintance with divine 
 things by the pouring out of the Spirit after his ascension; and to all 
 believers, into whose hearts he hath shined, he shines more and more. 
 Where Christ has <I>declared his Father's name, he will declare it;</I> 
 for <I>to him that hath shall be given;</I> and those that know God 
 both need and desire to know more of him. This is fitly pleaded for 
 them: "Father, own and favour them, for they will own and honour 
 thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What he aimed at in all this; not to fill their heads with curious 
 speculations, and furnish them with something to talk of among the 
 learned, but to secure and advance their real happiness in two 
 things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Communion with God: "Therefore I have given them the knowledge of 
 thy name, of all that whereby thou hast made thyself known, <I>that thy 
 love,</I> even that <I>wherewith thou hast loved me, may be,</I> not 
 only towards them, but <I>in them;</I>" that is, <I>First,</I> "Let 
 them have the fruits of that love for their sanctification; let <I>the 
 Spirit of love,</I> with which thou hast filled me, <I>be in them.</I>" 
 Christ declares his Father's name to believers, that with that divine 
 light darted into their minds a divine love may be shed abroad in their 
 hearts, to be in them a commanding constraining principle of holiness, 
 that they may partake of a divine nature. When God's love to us comes 
 to be in us, it is like the virtue which the loadstone gives the 
 needle, inclining it to move towards the pole; it draws out the soul 
 towards God in pious and devout affections, which are as the spirits of 
 the divine life in the soul. <I>Secondly,</I> "Let them have the taste 
 and relish of that love for their consolation; let them not only be 
 interested in the love of God, by having God's name declared to them, 
 but, by a further declaration of it, let them have the comfort of that 
 interest; that they may not only know God, but <I>know that they know 
 him,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:3">1 John ii. 3</A>.

 It is <I>the love of God</I> thus <I>shed abroad in the heart</I> that
 fills it with joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:3,5">Rom. v. 3, 5</A>.

 This God has provided for, that we may not only be satisfied with his
 loving kindness, but be satisfied of it; and so may live a life of 
 complacency in God and communion with him; this we must pray for, this 
 we must press after; if we have it, we must thank Christ for it; if we 
 want it, we may thank ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Union with Christ in order hereunto: <I>And I in them.</I> There 
 is no getting into the love of God but through Christ, nor can we keep 
 ourselves in that love but by abiding in Christ, that is, having him to 
 abide in us; nor can we have the sense and apprehension of that love 
 but by our experience of the indwelling of Christ, that is, the Spirit 
 of Christ in our hearts. It is <I>Christ in us that</I> is <I>the</I> 
 only <I>hope of glory</I> that will <I>not make us ashamed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:27">Col. i. 27</A>.

 All our communion with God, the reception of his love to us with our 
 return of love to him again, passes through the hands of the Lord 
 Jesus, and the comfort of it is owing purely to him. Christ had said 
 but a little before, <I>I in them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and here it is repeated (though the sense was complete without it), and
 the prayer closed with it, to show how much the heart of Christ was 
 sent upon it; all his petitions centre in this, and with this <I>the 
 prayers of Jesus, the Son of David, are ended: "I in them;</I> let me 
 have this, and I desire no more." It is the glory of the Redeemer to 
 dwell in the redeemed: it is his <I>rest for ever,</I> and he has 
 desired it. Let us therefore make sure our union with Christ, and then 
 take the comfort of his intercession. <I>This</I> prayer had an end,
 but <I>that</I> he ever lives to make.</P>
