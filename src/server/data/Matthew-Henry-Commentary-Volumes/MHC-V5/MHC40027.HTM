 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a very affecting story which is recorded in this chapter
 concerning the sufferings and death of our Lord Jesus. Considering the
 thing itself, there cannot be a more tragical story told us; common
 humanity would melt the heart, to find an innocent and excellent person
 thus misused. But considering the design and fruit of Christ's
 sufferings, it is gospel, it is good news, that Jesus Christ was thus
 delivered for our offences; and there is nothing we have more reason to
 glory in than the cross of Christ. In this chapter, observe,

 I. How he was prosecuted. 
 
 1. The delivering of him to Pilate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 2. The despair of Judas,

 4. The clamours of the people against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:15-25">ver. 15-25</A>.

 5. Sentence passed, and the warrant signed for his execution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:26">ver. 26</A>.

 II. How he was executed. 
 
 1. He was barbarously used, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:27-30">ver. 27-30</A>.

 2. Led to the place of execution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:31-33">ver. 31-33</A>.

 3. There he had all possible indignities done him, and reproaches cast 
 upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:34-44">ver. 34-44</A>.
 
 4. Heaven frowned upon him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders
 of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
 &nbsp; 2  And when they had bound him, they led <I>him</I> away, and
 delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
 &nbsp; 3  Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
 condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces
 of silver to the chief priests and elders,
 &nbsp; 4  Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent
 blood. And they said, What <I>is that</I> to us? see thou <I>to that.</I>
 &nbsp; 5  And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
 departed, and went and hanged himself.
 &nbsp; 6  And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is
 not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the
 price of blood.
 &nbsp; 7  And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's
 field, to bury strangers in.
 &nbsp; 8  Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto
 this day.
 &nbsp; 9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
 prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the
 price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel
 did value;
 &nbsp; 10  And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We left Christ in the hands of the chief priests and elders, condemned 
 to die, but they could only show their teeth; about two years before 
 this the Romans had taken from the Jews the power of capital 
 punishment; they could put no man to death, and therefore early in the 
 morning another council is held, to consider what is to be done. And 
 here we are told what was done in that morning-council, after they had 
 been for two or three hours consulting with their pillows.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ is delivered up to Pilate, that he might execute the sentence 
 they had passed upon him. Judea having been almost one hundred years 
 before this conquered by Pompey, had ever since been tributary to Rome, 
 and was lately made part of the province of Syria, and subject to the 
 government of the president of Syria, under whom there were several 
 <I>procurators,</I> who chiefly attended the business of the 
 <I>revenues,</I> but sometimes, as Pilate particularly, had the whole 
 power of the president lodged in them. This was a plain evidence that 
 <I>the sceptre was departed from Judah,</I> and that therefore now 
 <I>the Shiloh must come,</I> according to Jacob's prophecy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.

 Pilate is characterized by the Roman writers of that time, as a man of
 a rough and haughty spirit, wilful and implacable, and extremely 
 covetous and oppressive; the Jews had a great enmity to his person, and 
 were weary of his government, and yet they made use of him as the tool 
 of their malice against Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They <I>bound</I> Jesus. He was bound when he was first seized; but 
 either they took off these bonds when he was before the council, or now 
 they added to them. Having found him guilty, they tied his hands behind 
 him, as they usually do with convicted criminals. He was already bound 
 with the bonds of love to man, and of his own undertaking, else he had 
 soon broken these bonds, as Samson did his. We were fettered with the 
 <I>bond of iniquity,</I> held in the cords of our sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:22">Prov. x. 22</A>);

 but God had bound the <I>yoke of our transgressions</I> upon the neck
 of the Lord Jesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:14">Isa. l. 14</A>),

 that we might be loosed by his bonds, as we are <I>healed by his 
 stripes.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>They led him away</I> in a sort of triumph, led him <I>as a lamb 
 to the slaughter;</I> so <I>was he taken from prison and from 
 judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:7,8">Isa. liii. 7, 8</A>.

 It was nearly a mile from Caiaphas's house to Pilate's. All that way
 they led him through the streets of Jerusalem, when in the morning they 
 began to fill, to make him a spectacle to the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They <I>delivered him to Pontius Pilate;</I> according to that which 
 Christ had often said, that he should be <I>delivered to the 
 Gentiles.</I> Both Jews and Gentiles were obnoxious to the judgment of 
 God, and <I>concluded under sin,</I> and Christ was to be the Saviour 
 both of Jews and Gentiles; and therefore Christ was brought into the 
 judgment both of Jews and Gentiles, and both had a hand in his death. 
 See how these corrupt church-rulers abused the civil magistrate, making 
 use of him to execute their unrighteous decrees, and <I>inflict the 
 grievance which they had prescribed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:1">Isa. x. 1</A>.

 Thus have the kings of the earth been wretchedly imposed upon by the
 papal powers, and condemned to the drudgery of extirpating with the 
 sword of war, as well as that of justice, those whom they have marked 
 for heretics, right or wrong, to the great prejudice of their own 
 interests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The money which they had paid to Judas for betraying Christ, is by 
 him delivered back to them, and Judas, in despair, hangs himself. The 
 chief priests and elders supported themselves with <I>this,</I> in 
 prosecuting Christ, that his own disciple betrayed him to them; but 
 now, in the midst of the prosecution, that string failed them, and even 
 <I>he</I> is made to them a <I>witness</I> of Christ's innocency and a 
 monument of God's justice; which served, 

 1. For glory to Christ in the midst of his sufferings, and a specimen
 of his victory over Satan who had entered into Judas. 

 2. For warning to his persecutors, and to leave them the more
 inexcusable. If their heart had not been fully set in them to do this 
 evil, what Judas said and did, one would think, should have stopped the 
 prosecution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) See here how Judas <I>repented:</I> not like Peter, who repented, 
 believed, and was pardoned: no, he repented, despaired, and was ruined. 
 Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What induced him to repent. It was <I>when he saw that he was
 condemned.</I> Judas, it is probable, expected that either Christ would 
 have made his escape out of their hands, or would so have pleaded his 
 own cause at their bar as to have come off, and then Christ would have 
 had the honour, the Jews the shame, and he the money, and no harm done. 
 This he had no reason to expect, because he had so often heard his 
 Master say that he must be <I>crucified;</I> yet it is probable that he 
 did expect it, and when the event did not answer his vain fancy, then 
 he fell into this horror, when he saw the stream strong against Christ, 
 and him yielding to it. Note, Those who measure actions by the 
 consequences of them rather than by the divine law, will find 
 themselves mistaken in their measures. The way of sin is down-hill; and 
 if we cannot easily stop ourselves, much less can we stop others whom 
 we have set a going in a sinful way. He <I>repented himself;</I> that 
 is, he was filled with grief, anguish, and indignation, at himself, 
 when reflecting upon what he had done. When he was tempted to betray 
 his Master, the thirty pieces of silver looked very fine and 
 glittering, like the <I>wine, when it is red, and gives its colour in 
 the cup.</I> But when the thing was done, and the money paid, the 
 silver was become dross, it <I>bit like a serpent, and stung like an 
 adder.</I> Now his conscience flew in his face; "What have I done! What 
 a fool, what a wretch, am I, to sell my Master, and all my comfort and 
 happiness in him, for such a trifle! All these abuses and indignities 
 done him are chargeable upon me; it is owing to me, that he is bound 
 and condemned, spit upon and buffeted. I little thought it would have 
 come to this, when I made that wicked bargain; so foolish was I, and 
 ignorant, and so like a beast." Now he curses the bag he carried, the 
 money he coveted, the priests he dealt with, and the day that he was 
 born. The remembrance of his Master's goodness to him, which he had so 
 basely requited, the bowels of mercy he had spurned at, and the fair 
 warnings he had slighted, steeled his convictions, and made them the 
 more piercing. Now he found his Master's words true; <I>It were better 
 for that man, that he had never been born.</I> Note, Sin will soon 
 change its taste. Though it be <I>rolled under the tongue</I> as a 
 <I>sweet morsel,</I> in the bowels it will be turned into the <I>gall 
 of asps</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:12-14">Job xx. 12-14</A>),
 
 like John's book, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:9">Rev. x. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What were the indications of his repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He made restitution; <I>He brought again the thirty 
 pieces of silver to the chief priests,</I> when they were all together 
 publicly. Now the money burned in his conscience, and he was as sick of 
 it as ever he had been fond of it. Note, That which is ill gotten, will 
 never do good to those that get it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:10,Job+20:15">Jer. xiii. 10; Job xx. 15</A>.

 If he had repented, and brought the money back before he had betrayed
 Christ, he might have done it with comfort, then he had <I>agreed while 
 yet in the way;</I> but now it was too late, now he cannot do it 
 without horror, wishing ten thousand times he had never meddled with 
 it. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:3">Jam. v. 3</A>.
 
 He brought it again. Note, what is unjustly gotten, must not be kept;
 for that is a continuance in the sin by which it was got, and such an 
 avowing of it as is not consistent with repentance. He brought it to 
 those from whom he had it, to let them know that he repented his 
 bargain. Note, Those who have served and hardened others in their sin, 
 when God gives them repentance, should let them know it whose sins they 
 have been partakers in, that it may be a means to bring them to 
 repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He made confession 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 <I>I have sinner, in that I have betrayed innocent blood.</I> 

 1. To the <I>honour of Christ,</I> he pronounces his blood 
 <I>innocent.</I> If he had been guilty of any sinful practices, Judas, 
 as his disciple, would certainly have know it, and, as his betrayer, 
 would certainly have discovered it; but he, freely and without being 
 urged to it, pronounces him innocent, to the face of those who had 
 pronounced him <I>guilty.</I> 

 2. To <I>his own shame,</I> he confesses that he had sinned, in
 betraying this blood. He does not lay the blame on any one else; does 
 not say, "You have sinned, in hiring me to do it;" but takes it all to 
 himself; "I have sinned, in doing it." Thus far Judas went toward his 
 repentance, yet it was <I>not to salvation.</I> He confessed, but not 
 to God, did not go to him, and say, <I>I have sinned, Father, against 
 heaven.</I> He confessed the betraying of innocent blood, but did not 
 confess that wicked love of money, which was the root of this evil. 
 There are those who betray Christ, and yet justify themselves in it, 
 and so come short of Judas.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See here how the chief priests and elders entertained Judas's 
 penitential confession; they said, <I>What is that to us? See thou to 
 that.</I> He made them his confessors, and that was the 
 <I>absolution</I> they gave him; more like the priests of devils than 
 like the priests of the holy living God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] See here how carelessly they speak of the betraying of Christ. 
 Judas had told them that the blood of Christ was innocent blood; and 
 they said, <I>What is that to us?</I> Was it nothing to them that they 
 had thirsted after this blood, and hired Judas to betray it, and had 
 now condemned it to be shed unjustly? Is this nothing to them? Does it 
 give no check to the violence of their prosecution, no warning to take 
 need what they do to this just man? Thus do fools make a mock at sin, 
 as if no harm were done, no hazard run, by the commission of the 
 greatest wickedness. Thus light do many make of Christ crucified; what 
 is it to them, that he suffered such things?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] See here how carelessly they speak of the sin of Judas; he said, 
 <I>I have sinned,</I> and they said, "<I>What is that to us?</I> What 
 are we concerned in thy sin, that thou tellest us of it?" Note, It is 
 folly for us to think that the sins of others are nothing to us, 
 especially those sins that we are any way accessary to, or partakers 
 in. Is it nothing to us, that God is dishonoured, souls wounded, Satan 
 gratified and his interests served, and that we have aided and abetted 
 it? If the elders of Jezreel, to please Jezebel, murder Naboth, is that 
 nothing to Ahab? Yes, <I>he has killed,</I> for he has <I>taken 
 possession,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:19">1 Kings xxi. 19</A>.

 The guilt of sin is not so easily transferred as some people think it 
 is. If there were guilt in the matter, they tell Judas that he must 
 <I>look to it,</I> he must <I>bear it. First,</I> Because he had 
 betrayed him to them. His was indeed <I>the greater sin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:11">John xix. 11</A>);

 but it did not therefore follow, that theirs was no sin. It is a common
 instance of the deceitfulness of our hearts, to extenuate our own sin 
 by the aggravation of other people's sins. But the judgment of God is 
 according to truth, not according to comparison. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 Because he knew and believed him to be innocent. "If he be innocent, 
 see thou to it, that is more than we know; we have adjudged him 
 <I>guilty,</I> and therefore may justly prosecute him as such," Wicked 
 practices are buoyed up by wicked principles, and particularly by this, 
 That sin is sin only to those that think it to be so; that it is no 
 harm to persecute a good man, if we take him to be a bad man; but those 
 who thus think to mock God, will but deceive and destroy 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] See how carelessly they speak of the conviction, terror, and 
 remorse, that Judas was under. They were glad to make use of him in the 
 sin, and were then very fond of him; none more welcome to them than 
 Judas, when he said, <I>What will ye give me, and I will betray him to 
 you?</I> They did not say, <I>What is that to us?</I> But now that his 
 sin had put him into a fright, now they slighted him, had nothing to 
 say to him, but turned him over to his own terrors; why did he come to 
 trouble them with his melancholy fancies? They had something else to do 
 than to heed him. But why so shy? <I>First,</I> Perhaps they were in 
 some fear lest the sparks of his conviction, brought too near, should 
 kindle a fire in their own consciences, and lest his moans, listened 
 to, should give an alarm to their own convictions. Note, Obstinate 
 sinners stand upon their guard against convictions; and those that are 
 resolvedly impenitent, look with disdain upon the penitent. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> However, they were in no concern to succour Judas; 
 when they had brought him into the snare, they not only left him, but 
 laughed at him. Note, Sinners, under convictions, will find their old 
 companions in sin but miserable comforters. It is usual for those that 
 love the treason, to hate the traitor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Here is the utter despair that Judas was hereby driven into. If 
 the chief priests had promised him to stay the prosecution, it would 
 have been some comfort to him; but, seeing no hopes of that, he grew 
 desperate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>He cast down the pieces of silver in the temple.</I> The chief 
 priests would not take the money, for fear of taking thereby the whole 
 guilt to themselves, which they were willing that Judas should bear the 
 load of; Judas would not keep it, it was too hot for him to hold, he 
 therefore threw it down in the temple, that, whether they would or no, 
 it might fall into the hands of the chief priests. See what a 
 <I>drug</I> money was, when the guilt of <I>sin</I> was tacked to it, 
 or was thought to be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>He went, and hanged himself. First, He 
 retired</I>--<B><I>anechorese</I></B>; he withdrew into some solitary
 place, like the possessed man that was drawn by the devil into the 
 wilderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:29">Luke viii. 29</A>.

 Woe to him that is in despair, and is alone. If Judas had gone to
 Christ, or to some of the disciples, perhaps he might have had relief, 
 bad as the case was; but, missing of it with the chief priests, he 
 abandoned himself to despair: and the same devil that with the help of 
 the priests drew him to the sin, with their help drove him to despair. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> He became his own executioner; <I>He hanged 
 himself;</I> he was <I>suffocated</I> with grief, so Dr. Hammond: but
 Dr. Whitby is clear that our translation is right. Judas had a 
 <I>sight</I> and <I>sense</I> of sin, but no apprehension of the mercy 
 of God in Christ, and so <I>he pined away in his iniquity.</I> His sin, 
 we may suppose, was not in its own nature unpardonable: there were some 
 of those saved, that had been Christ's betrayers and murderers; but he 
 concluded, as Cain, that his iniquity was greater than could be 
 forgiven, and would rather throw himself on the devil's mercy than 
 God's. And some have said, that Judas sinned more in <I>despairing</I> 
 of the mercy of God, than in <I>betraying</I> his Master's blood. Now 
 the terrors of the Almighty set themselves in array against him. All 
 the curses written in God's book now <I>came into his bowels like 
 water, and like oil into his bones,</I> as was foretold concerning him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:18,19">Ps. cix. 18, 19</A>),

 and drove him to this desperate shift, for the escaping of a 
 <I>hell</I> within him, to leap into <I>that</I> before him, which was 
 but the perfection and perpetuity of this horror and despair. He throws 
 himself into the fire, to avoid the flame; but miserable is the case 
 when a man must go to hell for ease.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, in this story, 

 1. We have an instance of the wretched end of those into whom Satan
 enters, and particularly those that are given up to the love of money.
 This is the destruction in which many are drowned by it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:9,10">1 Tim. vi. 9, 10</A>.

 Remember what became of the swine into which, and of the traitor into
 whom, <I>the devil enters;</I> and <I>give not place to the devil.</I>
 
 2. We have an instance of the wrath of God revealed from heaven against
 the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18">Rom. i. 18</A>.

 As in the story of Peter we behold the goodness of God, and the
 triumphs of Christ's grace in the conversion of some sinners; so in the 
 story of Judas we behold the severity of God, and the triumphs of 
 Christ's power and justice in the confusion of other sinners. When 
 Judas, into whom Satan entered, was thus <I>hung up,</I> Christ made an 
 open show of the principalities and powers he undertook the <I>spoiling 
 of,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>.

 3. We have an instance of the direful effects of despair; it often ends 
 in self-murder. <I>Sorrow,</I> even that for sin, if not <I>according 
 to God, worketh death</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:10">2 Cor. vii. 10</A>),

 the worst kind of death; for <I>a wounded spirit, who can bear?</I> Let 
 us think as bad as we can of sin, provided we do not think it 
 unpardonable; let us despair of help in ourselves, but not of help in 
 God. He that thinks to ease his conscience by destroying his life, 
 doth, in effect, dare God Almighty to do his worst. And self-murder, 
 though prescribed by some of the heathen moralists, is certainly a 
 remedy worse than the disease, how bad soever the disease may be. Let 
 us watch against the beginnings of melancholy, and pray, Lord, <I>lead 
 us not into temptation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The disposal of the money which Judas brought back, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:6-10"><I>v.</I> 6-10</A>.

 It was laid out in the purchase of a field, called <I>the potter's 
 field;</I> because some potter had owned it, or occupied it, or lived 
 near it, or because broken potters' vessels were thrown into it. And 
 this field was to be a burying-place for strangers, that is, proselytes 
 to the Jewish religion, who were of other nations, and, coming to 
 Jerusalem to worship, happened to die there.

 [1.] It looks like an instance of their humanity, that they took care 
 for the <I>burying of strangers;</I> and it intimates that they 
 themselves allowed (as St. Paul saith,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:15">Acts xxiv. 15</A>),

 <I>that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and 
 of the unjust;</I> for we <I>therefore</I> take care of the dead body, 
 not only because it has been the habitation of a rational soul, but 
 because it must be so again. But,

 [2.] It was no instance of their humility that they would bury 
 strangers in a place by themselves, as if they were not worthy to be 
 laid in their burying-places; strangers must keep their distance, alive 
 and dead, and that principle must go down to the grace, <I>Stand by 
 thyself, come not near me, I am holier than thou,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5">Isa. lxv. 5</A>.

 The sons of Seth were better affected towards Abraham, though a
 stranger among them, when they offered him the choicest of their own
 sepulchres, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:6">Gen. xxiii. 6</A>.

 But <I>the sons of the stranger, that have joined themselves to the
 Lord,</I> though buried by themselves, shall rise with all that are 
 <I>dead in Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This buying of the potter's field did not take place on the day that 
 Christ died (they were then too busy to mind any thing else but hunting 
 him down); but it took place not long after; for Peter speaks of it 
 soon after Christ's ascension; yet it is here recorded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> To show the hypocrisy of the chief priests and elders. 
 They were maliciously persecuting the blessed Jesus, and now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They scruple to put that money into the treasury, or <I>corban,</I> 
 of the temple, with which they had hired the traitor. Though perhaps 
 they had taken it out of the treasury, pretending it was for the public 
 good, and though they were great sticklers for the <I>corban,</I> and 
 laboured to draw all the wealth of the nation into it, yet they would 
 not put that money into it, which was the price of blood. The hire of a 
 traitor they thought parallel to the hire of a whore, and the price of 
 a malefactor (such a one they made Christ to be) equivalent to the 
 price of a dog, neither of which was to be <I>brought into the house of 
 the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:18">Deut. xxiii. 18</A>.

 They would thus save their credit with the people, by possessing them
 with an opinion of their great reverence for the temple. Thus they that 
 <I>swallowed a camel, strained at a gnat.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They think to <I>atone</I> for what they had done, by this public 
 good act of providing a burying-place for strangers, though not at 
 their own charge. Thus in times of ignorance people were made to 
 believe that building churches and endowing monasteries would make 
 amends for immoralities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> To signify the favour intended by the blood of Christ 
 to <I>strangers,</I> and sinners of the Gentiles. Through the price of 
 his blood, a resting place is provided for them after death. Thus many 
 of the ancients apply this passage. The <I>grave</I> is the potter's
 field, where the bodies are thrown as despised broken vessels; but 
 Christ by his blood <I>purchased</I> it for those who by confessing 
 themselves <I>strangers</I> on earth seek the better country; he has 
 altered the property of it (as a purchaser doth), so that now death is
 ours, the grave is ours, a bed of rest for us. The Germans, in their
 language, call burying-places <I>God's fields;</I> for in them God
 <I>sows</I> his people as a <I>corn of wheat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24">John xii. 24</A>.
 
 See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:23,Isa+26:19">Hos. ii. 23; Isa. xxvi. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> To perpetuate the infamy of those that bought and sold 
 the blood of Christ. This field was commonly called <I>Aceldama--the
 field of blood;</I> not by the chief priests, they hoped in this 
 burying-place to bury the remembrance of their own crime; but by the 
 people; who took notice of Judas's acknowledgment that he had betrayed 
 the innocent blood, though the chief priests made nothing of it. They 
 fastened this name upon the field <I>in perpetuam rei memoriam--for a
 perpetual memorial.</I> Note, Divine Providence has many ways of 
 entailing disgrace upon the wicked practices even of great men, who, 
 though they seek to cover their shame, are <I>put to a perpetual 
 reproach.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> That we may see how the scripture was fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>);

 <I>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet.</I>
 The words quoted are found in the prophecy of Zechariah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:12"><I>ch.</I> xi. 12</A>.

 How they are here said to be spoken by Jeremy is a difficult question;
 but the credit of Christ's doctrine does not depend upon it; for that 
 proves itself perfectly divine, though there should appear something 
 human as to small circumstances in the penmen of it. The Syriac 
 version, which is ancient, reads only, <I>It was spoken by the 
 prophet,</I> not naming any, whence some have thought that 
 <I>Jeremy</I> was added by some scribe; some think that the whole 
 volume of the prophets, being in one book, and the prophecy of Jeremiah 
 put first, it might not be improper, <I>currente calamo--for a 
 transcriber</I> to quote any passage out of that volume, under his 
 name. The Jews used to say, <I>The spirit of Jeremiah was in 
 Zechariah,</I> and so they were as one prophet. Some suggest that it 
 was <I>spoken</I> by Jeremiah, but written by Zechariah; or that 
 Jeremiah wrote the ninth, tenth, and eleventh chapters of Zechariah.
 Now this passage in the prophet is a representation of the great 
 contempt of God, that was found among the Jews, and the poor returns 
 they made to him for rich receivings from him. But here that is really 
 acted, which was there but figuratively expressed. The sum of money is 
 the same--<I>thirty pieces of silver;</I> this they <I>weighed for his 
 price,</I> at this rate they valued him; a goodly price; and this was 
 <I>cast to the potter in the house of the Lord;</I> which was here 
 literally accomplished. Note, We should better understand the events of 
 Providence, if we were better acquainted even with the language and 
 expressions of scripture; for even those also are sometimes written 
 upon the dispensations of Providence so plainly, that <I>he who runs 
 may read them.</I> What David spoke figuratively 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:7">Ps. xlii. 7</A>),

 Jonah made a literal application of; <I>All thy waves and thy billows 
 are gone over me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:3">Jonah iii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The giving of the price of him that was valued, not for him, but for 
 the <I>potter's field,</I> bespeaks, 

 1. The high value that ought to be put upon Christ. The price was
 given, not for him; no, when it was given for him, it was soon brought
 back again with disdain, as infinitely below his worth; he cannot be
 <I>valued with the gold of Ophir,</I> nor this unspeakable Gift
 <I>brought with money.</I>

 2. The low value that was put upon him. <I>They of the children of
 Israel</I> did strangely undervalue him, when his price did but reach
 to buy a potter's field, a pitiful sorry spot of ground, not worth
 looking upon. It added to the reproach of his being bought and sold,
 that it was at so low a rate. <I>Cast it to the potter,</I> so it is in
 Zechariah; a contemptible petty chapman, not the merchant that deals in
 things of value. And observe, <I>They of the children of Israel</I>
 thus <I>undervalued him;</I> they who were his own people, that should
 have known better what estimate to put upon him, they to whom he was
 first sent, whose glory he was, and whom he had valued so highly, and
 bought so dear. He gave kings' ransoms for them, and the richest
 countries (so <I>precious were they in his sight,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:3,4">Isa. xliii. 3, 4</A>),

 Egypt, and Ethiopia, and Seba; but they gave a slave's ransom for him
 (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:32">Exod. xxi. 32</A>),

 and valued him but at the rate of a potter's field; so was that blood 
 trodden under foot, which bought the kingdom of heaven for us. But all
 this was <I>as the Lord appointed;</I> so the prophetic vision was, 
 which typified this event, and so the event itself, as the other 
 instances of Christ's sufferings, was <I>by the determinate counsel and 
 foreknowledge of God.</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked
 him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto
 him, Thou sayest.
 &nbsp; 12  And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
 answered nothing.
 &nbsp; 13  Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things
 they witness against thee?
 &nbsp; 14  And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the
 governor marvelled greatly.
 &nbsp; 15  Now at <I>that</I> feast the governor was wont to release unto
 the people a prisoner, whom they would.
 &nbsp; 16  And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
 &nbsp; 17  Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
 them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus
 which is called Christ?
 &nbsp; 18  For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
 &nbsp; 19  When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent
 unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for
 I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
 &nbsp; 20  But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude
 that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
 &nbsp; 21  The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the
 twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.
 &nbsp; 22  Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus
 which is called Christ? <I>They</I> all say unto him, Let him be
 crucified.
 &nbsp; 23  And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
 cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
 &nbsp; 24  When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but <I>that</I>
 rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed <I>his</I> hands
 before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this
 just person: see ye <I>to it.</I>
 &nbsp; 25  Then answered all the people, and said, His blood <I>be</I> on
 us, and on our children.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of what passed in Pilate's judgment-hall, when 
 the blessed Jesus was brought thither betimes in the morning. Though it 
 was no court-day, Pilate immediately took his case before him. We have 
 there,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The trial Christ had before Pilate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His arraignment; <I>Jesus stood before the governor,</I> as the 
 prisoner before the judge. We could not stand before God because of our 
 sins, nor lift up our face in his presence, if Christ had not been thus 
 made sin for us. He was arraigned that we might be discharged. Some 
 think that this bespeaks his courage and boldness; he stood 
 <I>undaunted,</I> unmoved by all their rage. He thus stood in this 
 judgment, that we might stand in God's judgment. He stood for a 
 <I>spectacle,</I> as Naboth, when he was arraigned, was <I>set on high 
 among the people.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His indictment; <I>Art thou the king of the Jews?</I> The Jews were 
 now not only under the government, but under the very jealous 
 inspection, of the Roman powers, which they were themselves to the 
 highest degree disaffected to, and yet now pretended a concern for, to 
 serve this turn; accusing Jesus as an Enemy to C&aelig;sar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:2">Luke xxiii. 2</A>),

 which they could produce no other proof of, than that he himself had 
 newly owned he was <I>the Christ.</I> Now they thought that whoever was 
 the Christ, must be the <I>king of the Jews,</I> and must deliver them 
 from the Roman power, and restore to them a temporal dominion, and 
 enable them to trample upon all their neighbours. According to this 
 chimera of their own, they accused our Lord Jesus, as making himself 
 king of the Jews, in opposition to the Roman yoke; whereas, though he 
 said that he was the Christ, he meant not such a Christ as this. Note, 
 Many oppose Christ's holy religion, upon a mistake of the nature of it; 
 they dress it up in false colours, and then fight against it. They 
 assuring the governor that, if he made himself Christ, he made himself 
 king of the Jews, the governor takes it for granted, that he goes about 
 to pervert the nation, and subvert the government. <I>Art thou a 
 king?</I> It was plain that he was not so <I>de facto--actually;</I> 
 "But dost thou lay any claim to the government, or pretend a right to 
 rule the Jews?" Note, It has often been the hard fate of Christ's holy 
 religion, unjustly to fall under the suspicions of the civil powers, as 
 if it were hurtful to kings and provinces, whereas it tends mightily to 
 the benefit of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His plea; <I>Jesus said unto him, "Thou sayest.</I> It is as thou 
 sayest, though not as thou meanest; I am a king, but not such a king as 
 thou dost suspect me to be." Thus before Pilate he witnessed a good 
 confession, and was not ashamed to own himself a king, though it looked 
 ridiculous, nor afraid, though at this time it was dangerous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The evidence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 He was <I>accused of the chief priests.</I> Pilate found <I>no fault in 
 him;</I> whatever was said, nothing was proved, and therefore what was 
 wanting in matter they made up in noise and violence, and followed him 
 with repeated accusations, the same as they had given in before; but by 
 the repetition they thought to force a belief from the governor. They 
 had learned, not only <I>calumniari--to calumniate,</I> but <I>fortiter 
 calumniari--to calumniate stoutly.</I> The best men have often been 
 accused of the worst crimes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The prisoner's silence as to the prosecutors' accusations; <I>He 
 answered nothing,</I> 

 (1.) Because there was no occasion; nothing was alleged but what 
 carried its own confutation along with it. 

 (2.) He was now taken up with the great concern that lay between him 
 and his Father, to whom he was offering up himself a Sacrifice, to 
 answer the demands of his justice, which he was so intent upon, that he 
 minded not what they said against him. 

 (3.) His hour was come, and he submitted to his Father's will; <I>Not 
 as I will, but as thou wilt.</I> He knew what his Father's will was, 
 and therefore silently <I>committed himself to him that judgeth 
 righteously. We</I> must not thus by our silence throw away our lives, 
 because we are not lords of our lives, as Christ was of his; nor can we 
 know, as he did, when our hour is come. But hence we must learn,
 <I>not to render railing for railing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:23">1 Pet. ii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now,

 [1.] Pilate pressed him to make some reply

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 <I>Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</I> What
 these things were, may be gathered from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:3,5,Joh+19:7">Luke xxiii. 3, 5, and John xix. 7</A>.

 Pilate, having no malice at all against him, was desirous he should 
 clear himself, urges him to it, and believes he could do it; <I>Hearest 
 thou not?</I> Yes, he did hear; and still he hears all that is 
 witnessed unjustly against his truths and ways; but he keeps silence, 
 because it is the day of his patience, and doth not answer, as he will 
 shortly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:3">Ps. l. 3</A>.

 [2.] He wondered at his silence; which was not interpreted so much into
 a contempt of the court, as a contempt of himself. And therefore Pilate 
 is not said to be angry at it, but to have <I>marvelled greatly</I> at 
 it, as a thing very unusual. He believed him to be innocent, and had 
 heard perhaps that <I>never man spake like him;</I> and therefore he 
 thought it strange that he had not one word to say for himself. We 
 have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The outrage and violence of the people, in pressing the governor to 
 crucify Christ. The chief priests had a great interest in the people, 
 they called them <I>Rabbi, Rabbi,</I> made idols of them, and oracles 
 of all they said; and they made use of this to incense them against 
 him, and by the power of the mob gained the point which they could not 
 otherwise carry. Now here are two instances of their outrage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their preferring Barabbas before him, and choosing to have him 
 released rather than Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It seems it was grown into a custom with the Roman governors, for 
 the honouring of the Jews, to grace the feast of the passover with the 
 release of a prisoner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This, they thought, did honour to the feast, and was agreeable to the 
 commemoration of their deliverance; but it was an invention of their 
 own, and no divine institution; though some think that it was ancient, 
 and kept up by the Jewish princes, before they became a province of the 
 empire. However, it was a bad custom, an obstruction to justice, and an 
 encouragement to wickedness. But our gospel-passover is celebrated
 with the release of prisoners, by him who hath <I>power on earth to 
 forgive sins.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The prisoner put in competition with our Lord Jesus was Barabbas; 
 he is here called a <I>notable</I> prisoner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 either because by birth and breeding he was of some note and quality, 
 or because he had signalized himself by something remarkable in his 
 crimes; whether he was so <I>notable</I> as to recommend himself the 
 more to the favours of the people, and so the more likely to be 
 interceded for, or whether so <I>notable</I> as to make himself more 
 liable to their age, is uncertain. Some think the latter, and therefore 
 Pilate mentioned him, as taking it for granted that they would have 
 desired any one's release rather than his. <I>Treason, murder,</I> and 
 <I>felony,</I> are the three most enormous crimes that are usually 
 punished by the sword of justice; and Barabbas was guilty of all three, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:19,Joh+18:40">Luke xxiii. 19; John xviii. 40</A>.

 A <I>notable prisoner</I> indeed, whose crimes were so complicated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The proposal was made by Pilate the governor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 <I>Whom will ye that I release unto you?</I> It is probable that the 
 judge had the nomination of two, one of which the people were to 
 <I>choose.</I> Pilate proposed to them to have Jesus <I>released;</I> 
 he was convinced of his innocency, and that the prosecution was 
 malicious; yet had not the courage to acquit him, as he ought to have 
 done, by his own power, but would have him released by the people's 
 election, and so he hoped to satisfy both his own <I>conscience,</I> 
 and the <I>people</I> too; whereas, finding no fault in him, he ought 
 not to have <I>put him upon the country,</I> or brought him <I>into 
 peril of his life.</I> But such little tricks and artifices as these, 
 to trim the matter, and to keep in with conscience and the world too, 
 are the common practice of those that seek more to please men than God. 
 <I>What shall I do then,</I> saith Pilate, <I>with Jesus, who is called 
 Christ?</I> He puts the people in mind of this, that this <I>Jesus,</I> 
 whose release he proposed, was looked upon by some among them as the 
 Messiah, and had given pregnant proofs of his being so; "Do not 
 <I>reject</I> one of whom your nation has professed such an 
 expectation."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The reason why Pilate <I>laboured</I> thus to get Jesus 
 <I>discharged</I> was because he knew that <I>for envy the chief 
 priests had delivered him up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 that it was not his <I>guilt,</I> but his goodness, that they were 
 provoked at; and for this reason he <I>hoped</I> to bring him off by 
 the people's act, and that they would be for his release. When David 
 was <I>envied</I> by Saul, he was the <I>darling of the people;</I> and 
 any one that heard the <I>hosannas</I> with which Christ was but a few 
 days ago brought into Jerusalem, would have thought that he had been 
 so, and that Pilate might safely have referred this matter to the 
 commonalty, especially when so notorious a rogue was set up as a rival 
 with him for their favours. But it proved otherwise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) While Pilate was thus labouring the matter, he was confirmed in 
 his unwillingness to condemn Jesus, by a message sent him from his wife 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 by way of caution; <I>Have thou nothing to do with that just man</I> 
 (together with the reason), <I>for I have suffered many things this day 
 in a cream because of him.</I> Probably, this message was delivered to 
 Pilate publicly, in the hearing of all that were present, for it was 
 intended to be a warning not to him only, but to the prosecutors. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The special providence of God, in sending this dream to Pilate's 
 wife; it is not likely that she had heard any thing, before, concerning 
 Christ, at least not so as to occasion her dreaming of him, but it was 
 immediately from God: perhaps she was one of the <I>devout and 
 honourable women,</I> and had some sense of religion; yet God revealed 
 himself by dreams to some that had not, as to Nebuchadnezzar. She 
 <I>suffered many things</I> in this dream; whether she dreamed of the 
 cruel usage of an innocent person, or of the judgments that would fall 
 upon those that had any hand in his death, or both, it seems that it 
 was a frightful dream, and her thoughts <I>troubled her,</I> as 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:1,4:5">Dan. ii. 1; iv. 5</A>.

 Note, The Father of spirits has many ways of access to the spirits of
 men, and can <I>seal their instruction in a dream, or vision of the 
 night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:15,16">Job xxxiii. 15, 16</A>.

 Yet to those who have the written word, God more ordinarily speaks by
 conscience on a waking bed, than by dreams, when <I>deep sleep falls 
 upon men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The tenderness and care of Pilate's wife, in sending this caution, 
 thereupon, to her husband; <I>Have nothing to do with that just man. 
 First,</I> This was an honourable testimony to our Lord Jesus, 
 witnessing for him that he was a <I>just man,</I> even then when he was 
 persecuted as the worst of malefactors: when his friends were afraid to 
 appear in defence of him, God made even those that were strangers and 
 enemies, to speak in his favour; when Peter denied him, Judas confessed 
 him; when the chief priests pronounced him guilty of death, Pilate 
 declared he <I>found no fault</I> in him; when the women that loved him 
 stood afar off, Pilate's wife, who knew little of him, showed a concern 
 for him. Note, God will not leave himself without witnesses to the 
 truth and equity of his cause, even when it seems to be most spitefully 
 run down by its enemies, and most shamefully deserted by its friends. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> It was a fair warning to Pilate; <I>Have nothing to do 
 with him.</I> Note, God has many ways of giving checks to sinners in 
 their sinful pursuits, and it is a great mercy to have such checks from 
 Providence, from faithful friends, and from our own consciences; it is 
 also our great duty to hearken to them. <I>O do not this abominable 
 thing which the Lord hates,</I> is what we may hear said to us, when we 
 are entering into temptation, if we will but regard it. Pilate's lady 
 sent him this warning, out of the love she had to him; she feared not a 
 rebuke from him for meddling with that which belonged not to her; but, 
 let him take it how he would, she would give him the caution. Note, It 
 is an instance of true love to our friends and relations, to do what we 
 can to keep them from sin; and the nearer any are to us, and the 
 greater affection we have for them, the more solicitous we should be 
 not to suffer sin to come or lie upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17">Lev. xix. 17</A>.

 The best friendship is friendship to the soul. We are not told how 
 Pilate turned this off, probably with a jest; but by his proceeding 
 against the just man it appears that he did not regard it. Thus 
 faithful admonitions are made light of, when they are given as warnings 
 against sin, but will not be so easily made light of, when they shall 
 be reflected upon as aggravations of sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The chief priests and the elders were busy, all this while, to 
 influence the people in favour of Barabbas, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 They <I>persuaded the multitude,</I> both by themselves and their 
 emissaries, whom they sent abroad among them, <I>that they should ask 
 Barabbas, and destroy Jesus;</I> suggesting that this Jesus was a 
 deceiver, in league with Satan, an enemy to their church and temple; 
 that, if he were let alone, the Romans would come, and take away their 
 place and nation; that Barabbas, though a bad man, yet, having not the 
 interest that Jesus had, could not do so much mischief. Thus they 
 managed the mob, who otherwise were well affected to Jesus, and, if 
 they had not been so much at the beck of their priests, would never 
 have done such a preposterous thing as to prefer Barabbas before Jesus. 
 Here,

 [1.] We cannot but look upon these wicked priests with indignation; by 
 the law, in <I>matters of controversy between blood and blood,</I> the 
 people were to be guided by the priests, and to do as they informed 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:8,9">Deut. xvii. 8, 9</A>.

 This great power put into their hands they wretchedly abused, and the 
 leaders of the people caused them to err.

 [2.] We cannot but look upon the deluded people with pity; <I>I have
 compassion on the multitude,</I> to see them hurried thus violently to 
 so great wickedness, to see them thus priest-ridden, and falling in the 
 ditch with their <I>blind leaders.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Being thus over-ruled by the priests, at length they made their 
 choice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 <I>Whether of the twain</I> (saith Pilate) <I>will ye that I release
 unto you?</I> He hoped that he had gained his point, to have Jesus 
 released. But, to his great surprise, they said <I>Barabbas;</I> as if 
 his <I>crimes</I> were <I>less,</I> and therefore he less <I>deserved 
 to die;</I> or as if his <I>merits</I> were <I>greater,</I> and 
 therefore he better <I>deserved to live.</I> The cry for Barabbas was 
 so universal, one and all, that there was no colour to demand a poll 
 between the candidates. <I>Be astonished, O heavens, at this, and, thou 
 earth, be horribly afraid!</I> Were ever men that pretended to reason 
 or religion, guilty of such prodigious madness, such horrid wickedness! 
 This was it that Peter charged so home upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:14">Acts iii. 14</A>);

 <I>Ye desired a murderer to be granted to you;</I> yet multitudes who 
 choose the world, rather than God, for their ruler and portion, thus 
 <I>choose their own delusions.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their pressing earnestly to have Jesus crucified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 Pilate, being amazed at their choice of Barabbas, was willing to hope 
 that it was rather from a fondness for him than from an enmity to 
 Jesus; and therefore he puts it to them, "<I>What shall I do then with 
 Jesus?</I> Shall I release him likewise, for the greater honour of your 
 feast, or will you leave it to me?" No, <I>they all said, Let him be 
 crucified.</I> That death they desired he might die, because it was 
 looked upon as the most scandalous and ignominious; and they hoped 
 thereby to make his followers ashamed to own him, and their relation to 
 him. It was absurd for them to prescribe to the judge what sentence he 
 should pass; but their malice and rage made them forget all rules of 
 order and decency, and turned a court of justice into a <I>riotous, 
 tumultuous,</I> and <I>seditious assembly.</I> Now was truth fallen in 
 the street, and equity could not enter; where one <I>looked for 
 judgment, behold, oppression,</I> the worst kind of oppression; for 
 righteousness, behold, a cry, the worse cry that ever was, <I>Crucify, 
 crucify</I> the Lord of glory. Though they that cried thus, perhaps, 
 were not the same persons that the other day cried <I>Hosanna,</I> yet 
 see what a change was made upon the mind of the populace in a little 
 time: when he <I>rode in triumph</I> into Jerusalem, so <I>general</I> 
 were the <I>acclamations of praise,</I> that one would have thought he 
 had <I>no enemies;</I> but now when he was <I>led in triumph</I> to 
 Pilate's judgment-seat, so <I>general</I> were the <I>outcries</I> of 
 enmity, that one would think he had <I>no friends.</I> Such revolutions 
 are there in this changeable world, through which our way to heaven 
 lies, as our Master's did, <I>by honour and dishonour, by evil report, 
 and good report,</I> counter-changed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:8">2 Cor. vi. 8</A>);

 that we may not be lifted up by honour, as if, when we were applauded 
 and caressed, we had <I>made our nest among the stars,</I> and should 
 <I>die in that nest;</I> nor yet be dejected or discouraged by 
 dishonour, as if, when we were trodden to the lowest hell, from which 
 there is <I>no redemption. Bides tu istos qui te laudant; omnes aut 
 sunt hostes, aut (quod in &aelig;quo est) esse possunt--You observe 
 those who applaud you; either they are all your enemies, or, which is 
 equivalent, they may become so.</I> Seneca de Vita Beat.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, as to this demand, we are further told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How Pilate objected against it; <I>Why, what evil hath he 
 done?</I> A proper question to ask before we censure any in common 
 discourse, much more for a judge to ask before he pass a sentence of 
 death. Note, It is much for the honour of the Lord Jesus, that, though 
 he suffered as an evil-doer, yet neither his judge nor his prosecutors 
 could find that he had done any evil. Had he done any evil <I>against 
 God?</I> No, he <I>always did those things that pleased him.</I> Had he 
 done any evil against the <I>civil government?</I> No, as he did 
 himself, so he taught others, to <I>render to C&aelig;sar the things that
 were C&aelig;sar's.</I> Had he done any evil against the <I>public
 peace?</I> No, he did not <I>strive or cry,</I> nor did his kingdom 
 <I>come with observation.</I> Had he done any evil to particular 
 persons? <I>Whose ox had he taken, or whom had he defrauded?</I> No, so 
 far from that, that he <I>went about doing good.</I> This repeated 
 assertion of his unspotted innocency, plainly intimates that he died to 
 satisfy for the sins of others; for if it had not been for our 
 transgressions that he was thus wounded, and for our offences that he 
 was delivered up, and that upon his own voluntary undertaking to atone 
 for them, I see not how these extraordinary sufferings of a person that 
 had never thought, said, or done, any thing amiss, could be reconciled 
 with the justice and equity of that providence that governs the world, 
 and at least <I>permitted</I> this to be done in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How they <I>insisted</I> upon it; <I>They cried out the more, Let 
 him be crucified.</I> They do not go about to show any evil he had 
 done, but, right or wrong, he must be <I>crucified.</I> Quitting all 
 pretensions to the proof of the premises, they resolve to hold the 
 conclusion, and what was wanting in evidence to make up in clamour; 
 this unjust judge was wearied by importunity into an unjust sentence, 
 as he in the parable into a just one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:4,5">Luke xviii. 4, 5</A>),

 and the cause carried purely by noise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the <I>devolving</I> of the <I>guilt</I> of Christ's blood 
 upon the <I>people</I> and <I>priests.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Pilate endeavours to transfer it from himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He sees it <I>to no purpose to contend.</I> What he said, 

 [1.] Would do no good; <I>he could prevail nothing;</I> he could not 
 convince them what an unjust unreasonable thing it was for him to 
 condemn a man whom he believed innocent, and whom they could not prove 
 guilty. See how strong the stream of lust and rage sometimes is; 
 neither authority nor reason will prevail to give check to it. Nay, 
 
 [2.] It was more likely to <I>do hurt;</I> he saw that rather a 
 <I>tumult was made.</I> This rude and brutish people fell to high 
 words, and began to threaten Pilate what they would do if he did not 
 gratify them; and how great a matter might this fire kindle, especially 
 when the priests, those great incendiaries, blew the coals! Now this 
 turbulent tumultuous temper of the Jews, by which Pilate was awed to 
 condemn Christ against his conscience, contributed more than any thing 
 to the ruin of that nation not long after; for their frequent 
 insurrections provoked the Romans to destroy them, though they had 
 reduced them, and their inveterate quarrels among themselves made them 
 an easy prey to the common enemy. Thus their sin was their ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe how easily we may be mistaken in the inclination of the common 
 people; the priests were apprehensive that their endeavours to 
 <I>seize</I> Christ would have caused an uproar, especially <I>on the 
 feast day;</I> but it proved that Pilate's endeavour to <I>save</I> 
 him, caused an uproar, and that on the feast day; so uncertain are the 
 sentiments of the crowd.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) This puts him into a <I>great strait,</I> betwixt the peace of his 
 own mind, and the peace of the city; he is loth to condemn an innocent 
 man, and yet loth to <I>disoblige</I> the people, and raise a devil 
 that would not be soon laid. Had he steadily and resolutely adhered to 
 the sacred laws of justice, as a judge ought to do, he had not been in 
 any perplexity; the matter was plain and past dispute, that a man in 
 whom was found <I>no faulty,</I> ought not to be crucified, upon any 
 pretence whatsoever, nor must an unjust thing be done, to gratify any 
 man or company of men in the world; the cause is soon decided; <I>Let 
 justice be done, though heaven and earth come together--Fiat justitia,
 ruat c&oelig;lum.</I> If <I>wickedness proceed from the wicked,</I> though 
 they be priests, yet <I>my hand shall not be upon him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Pilate thinks to trim the matter, and to pacify both the people
 and his own conscience too, by <I>doing it,</I> and yet 
 <I>disowning</I> it, <I>acting</I> the thing, and yet <I>acquitting</I> 
 himself from it at the same time. Such absurdities and 
 self-contradictions do <I>they</I> run upon, whose convictions are 
 <I>strong,</I> but their corruptions <I>stronger. Happy is he</I> 
 (saith the apostle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:22">Rom. xiv. 22</A>)

 <I>that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth;</I> or, 
 which is all one, that <I>allows</I> not himself in that thing which he 
 <I>condemns.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now Pilate endeavours to clear himself from the guilt,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] By a <I>sign;</I> He <I>took water, and washed his hands before 
 the multitude;</I> not as if he thought thereby to cleanse himself from 
 any guilt contracted before God, but to acquit himself before the 
 people, from so much as contracting any guilt in this matter; as if he 
 had said, "If it be done, bear witness that it is none of my doing." He 
 <I>borrowed</I> the ceremony from that law which appointed it to be 
 used for the clearing of the country from the guilt of an undiscovered 
 murder 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:6,7">Deut. xxi. 6, 7</A>);

 and he used it the more to affect the people with the conviction he was 
 under of the prisoner's innocency; and, probably, such was the noise of 
 the rabble, that, if he had not used some such surprising sign, in the 
 view of them all, he could not have been heard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] By a <I>saying;</I> in which, <I>First,</I> He <I>clears</I> 
 himself; <I>I am innocent of the blood of this just person.</I> What 
 nonsense was this, to condemn him, and yet protest that he was innocent 
 of his blood! For men to protest against a thing, and yet to practise 
 it, is only to proclaim that they sin against their consciences. Though 
 Pilate professed his innocency, God charges him with guilt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:27">Acts iv. 27</A>.
 
 Some think to justify themselves, by pleading that their <I>hands</I>
 were not in the sin; but David kills by the sword of the children of 
 Ammon, and Ahab by the elders of Jezreel. Pilate here thinks to justify 
 himself, by pleading that his <I>heart</I> was not in the action; but 
 this is an averment which will never be admitted. <I>Protestatio non
 valet contra factum--In vain does he protest against the deed which at
 the same time he perpetrates. Secondly,</I> He casts it upon the 
 priests and people; "<I>See ye to it;</I> if it must be done, I cannot 
 help it, do you answer it before God and the world." Note, Sin is a 
 brat that nobody is willing to own; and many deceive themselves with 
 this, that they shall bear no blame if they can but find any to lay the 
 blame upon; but it is not so easy a thing to transfer the guilt of sin 
 as many think it is. The condition of him that is infected with the 
 plague is not the less dangerous, either for his catching the infection 
 from others, or his communicating the infection to others; we may be 
 <I>tempted</I> to sin, but cannot be <I>forced.</I> The priests threw 
 it upon Judas; <I>See thou to it;</I> and now Pilate throws it upon 
 them; <I>See ye to it; for with what measure ye mete, it shall be 
 measured to you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The priests and people<I> consented</I> to take the guilt <I>upon 
 themselves;</I> they all said, "<I>His blood be on us, and one our 
 children;</I> we are so well assured that there is neither sin nor 
 danger in putting him to death, that we are willing to run the hazard 
 of it;" as if the guilt would do no harm to them or theirs. They saw 
 that it was the dread of guilt that made Pilate hesitate, and that he 
 was getting over this difficulty by a fancy of transferring it; to 
 prevent the return of his hesitation, and to confirm him in that fancy, 
 they, in the heat of their rage, agreed to it, rather than lose the 
 prey they had in their hands, and cried, <I>His blood be upon us.</I> 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By this they designed to indemnify Pilate, that is, to make him 
 think himself indemnified, by becoming bound to divine justice, to save 
 him harmless. But those that are themselves bankrupts and beggars will 
 never be admitted security for others, nor taken as a bail for them. 
 None could bear the sin of others, except him that had none of his own 
 to answer for; it is a bold undertaking, and too big for any creature, 
 to become bound for a sinner to Almighty God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) But they did really imprecate wrath and vengeance upon themselves 
 and their posterity. What a desperate word was this, and how little did 
 they think what as the direful import of it, or to what an abyss of 
 misery it would bring them and theirs! Christ had lately told them,
 that upon them would come <I>all the righteous blood shed upon the 
 earth,</I> from that of the righteous Abel; but as if that were too 
 little, they here imprecate upon themselves the guilt of that blood 
 which was more precious than all the rest, and the guilt of which would 
 lie heavier. O the daring presumption of wilful sinners, that <I>run 
 upon God, upon his neck,</I> and defy his justice! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:25,26">Job xv. 25, 26</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How <I>cruel</I> they were in their <I>imprecation.</I> They 
 imprecated the punishment of this sin, not only upon themselves, but 
 upon <I>their children</I> too, even those that were yet unborn, 
 without so much as limiting the entail of the curse, as God himself had 
 been pleased to limit it, to the <I>third and fourth generation.</I> It 
 was madness to pull it upon themselves, but the height of barbarity to 
 entail it on their posterity. Surely they were like the ostrich; they 
 were <I>hardened against their young ones,</I> as though they were not 
 <I>theirs.</I> What a dreadful conveyance was this of guilt and wrath 
 to them and their heirs for ever, and this delivered by <I>joint 
 consent, nemine contradicents--unanimously,</I> as their own <I>act and
 deed;</I> which certainly amounted to a forfeiture and defeasance of 
 that ancient charter, <I>I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed.</I> 
 Their entailing the curse of the Messiah's blood upon their nation, cut 
 off the entail of the blessings of that blood from <I>their</I> 
 families, that, according to another promise made to Abraham, in him 
 <I>all the families of the earth</I> might be blessed. See what enemies 
 wicked men are to their own children and families; those that damn 
 their own souls, care not how many they take to hell with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How righteous God was, in his retribution according to this 
 imprecation; they said, <I>His blood be on us, and on our children;</I> 
 and God said <I>Amen</I> to it, so shall thy doom be; as they <I>loved 
 cursing,</I> so it came upon them. The wretched remains of that 
 abandoned people feel it to this day; from the time they imprecated 
 this blood upon them, they were followed with one judgment after 
 another, till they were quite laid waste, and made an astonishment, a 
 hissing, and a byword; yet on some of them, and some of theirs, this 
 blood came, not to <I>condemn</I> them, but to <I>save</I> them; divine 
 mercy, upon their repenting and believing, cut off this entail, and 
 then <I>the promise</I> was again <I>to them, and to their 
 children.</I> God is better to us and ours than we are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have the <I>preparatives</I> for, and 
 <I>prefaces</I> to, the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sentence passed, and the warrant signed for his execution; and 
 this <I>immediately,</I> the same hour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Barabbas was released, that notorious criminal: if he had not been 
 put in competition with Christ for the favour of the people, it is 
 probable that he had died for his crimes; but that proved the means of 
 his escape; to intimate that Christ was condemned for this purpose, 
 that sinners, even the chief of sinners, might be <I>released;</I> he 
 was <I>delivered up,</I> that we might be delivered; whereas the 
 <I>common instance</I> of divine Providence, is, that <I>the wicked is 
 a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:18,Pr+11:18">Prov. xxi. 18; xi. 18</A>.

 In this <I>unparalleled instance</I> of divine grace, the
 <I>upright</I> is a <I>ransom for the transgressors,</I> the just for 
 the unjust.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Jesus was <I>scourged;</I> this was an ignominious cruel punishment, 
 especially as is was inflicted by the Romans, who were not under the 
 moderation of the Jewish law, which forbade scourgings, above forty 
 stripes; this punishment was most unreasonably inflicted on one that 
 was sentenced to die: the <I>rods</I> were not to introduce the axes, 
 but to supersede them. Thus the scripture was fulfilled, <I>The 
 ploughers ploughed upon my back</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:3">Ps. cxxix. 3</A>),

 <I>I gave my back to the smiters</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:6">Isa. l. 6</A>),

 and, <I>By his stripes we are healed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:5">Isa. liii. 5</A>.

 He was <I>chastised with whips,</I> that we might not be for ever 
 <I>chastised with scorpions.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He was then <I>delivered to be crucified;</I> though his 
 chastisement was in order to our peace, yet there is no peace made but 
 by the <I>blood of his cross</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:20">Col. i. 20</A>);

 therefore the scourging is not enough, he must be <I>crucified;</I> a 
 kind of death used only among the Romans; the manner of it is such, 
 that it seems to be the result of wit and cruelty in combination, each 
 putting forth itself to the utmost, to make death in the highest degree 
 terrible and miserable. A cross was set up in the ground, to which the
 hands and feet were nailed, on which nails the weight of the body hung, 
 till it died of the pain. This was the death to which Christ was 
 condemned, that he might answer the type of the brazen serpent lifted 
 up upon a pole. It was a bloody death, a painful, shameful, cursed 
 death; it was so miserable a death, that merciful princes appointed 
 those who were condemned to it by the law, to be strangled first, and 
 then nailed to the cross; so Julius C&aelig;sar did by some pirates, 
 <I>Sueton. lib.</I> 1. Constantine, the first Christian emperor, by an 
 edict abolished the use of that punishment among the Romans, 
 <I>Sozomen, Hist. lib.</I> 1. <I>ch.</I> 8. <I>Ne salutare signum
 subserviret ad perniciem--That the symbol of salvation might not be 
 subservient to the victim's destruction.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The barbarous treatment which the soldiers gave him, while things 
 were getting ready for his execution. When he was condemned, he ought 
 to have had some time allowed him to prepare for death. There was a law 
 made by the Roman senate, in Tiberius's time, perhaps upon complaint of 
 this and the like precipitation, that the execution of criminals should 
 be deferred at least <I>ten days</I> after sentence. <I>Sueton in 
 Tiber. cap.</I> 25. But there were scarcely allowed so many minutes to 
 our Lord Jesus; nor had he any breathing-time during those minutes; it 
 was a <I>crisis,</I> and there were no <I>lucid intervals</I> allowed 
 him; <I>deep called unto deep,</I> and the storm continued without any 
 intermission.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When he was <I>delivered</I> to be <I>crucified,</I> that was enough; 
 they that <I>kill the body,</I> yield that there is no more that they 
 <I>can do,</I> but Christ's enemies will <I>do more,</I> and, if it be 
 possible, wrap up a thousand deaths in one. Though Pilate pronounced 
 him innocent, yet his soldiers, his guards, set themselves to abuse 
 him, being swayed more by the fury of the people <I>against him,</I> 
 than by their master's testimony <I>for him;</I> the Jewish 
 <I>rabble</I> infected the Roman soldiery, or perhaps it was not so 
 much in spite to him, as to make <I>sport</I> for themselves, that they 
 thus abused him. They understood that he <I>pretended to a crown; to 
 taunt</I> him with that gave them some diversion, and an opportunity to 
 make themselves and one another merry. Note, It is an argument of a 
 base, servile, sordid spirit, to insult over those that are in misery, 
 and to make the calamities of any matter of sport and merriment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. <I>Where</I> this was done--in the <I>common hall.</I> The
 <I>governor's house,</I> which should have been a shelter to the 
 wronged and abused, is made the theatre of this barbarity. I wonder 
 that the governor, who was so desirous to acquit himself from the blood 
 of this just person, would suffer this to be done in <I>his</I> house. 
 Perhaps he did not order it to be done, but he <I>connived</I> at it; 
 and those in authority will be accountable, not only for the wickedness 
 which they <I>do,</I> or <I>appoint,</I> but for that which they do not 
 restrain, when it is in the power of their hands. Masters of families 
 should not suffer their houses to be places of abuse to any, nor their 
 servants to make sport with the sins, or miseries, or religion, of 
 others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>Who</I> were concerned in it. They gathered the <I>whole 
 band,</I> the soldiers that were to attend the execution, would have 
 the whole regiment (at least five hundred, some think twelve or 
 thirteen hundred) to share in the diversion. If Christ was thus made a 
 <I>spectacle,</I> let none of his followers think it strange to be so 
 used, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:9,Heb+10:33">1 Cor. iv. 9; Heb. x. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What particular indignities were done him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They <I>stripped him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The shame of nakedness came in with sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:7">Gen. iii. 7</A>);

 and therefore Christ, when he came to satisfy for sin, and take it 
 away, was <I>made naked,</I> and submitted to <I>that shame,</I> that 
 he might prepare for us <I>white raiment, to cover us,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:18">Rev. iii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They <I>put on him a scarlet robe,</I> some old red cloak, such as 
 the Roman soldiers wore, in imitation of the <I>scarlet robes</I> which 
 kings and emperors wore; thus upbraiding him with his being called <I>a 
 King.</I> This <I>sham</I> of majesty they put upon him in his dress, 
 when nothing but meanness and misery appeared in his countenance, only 
 to expose him to the spectators, as the more <I>ridiculous;</I> yet 
 there was something of <I>mystery</I> in it; this was he that was 
 <I>red in his apparel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:1,2">Isa. lxiii. 1, 2</A>),

 that <I>washed his garments in wine</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:11">Gen. xlix. 11</A>);

 therefore he was dressed in a <I>scarlet robe.</I> Our sins were as 
 <I>scarlet and crimson.</I> Christ being clad in a <I>scarlet robe,</I> 
 signified his bearing our sins, to his shame, in his own body upon the 
 tree; that we might wash our robes, and make them white, in the blood 
 of the Lamb.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They <I>platted a crown of thorns, and put it upon his head,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 This was to carry on the humour of making him a <I>mock-king;</I> yet, 
 had they intended it only for a <I>reproach,</I> they might have 
 <I>platted a crown of straw,</I> or <I>rushes,</I> but they designed it 
 to be painful to him, and to be <I>literally,</I> what crowns are said 
 to be figuratively, lined with thorns; he that invented this abuse, it 
 is likely, valued himself upon the wit of it; but there was a mystery 
 in it.

 [1.] Thorns came in with sin, and were part of the curse that was the 
 product of sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:18">Gen. iii. 18</A>.

 Therefore Christ, being made a <I>curse for us,</I> and dying to remove 
 the curse from us, felt the pain and smart of those thorns, nay, and 
 <I>binds them as a crown</I> to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:36">Job xxxi. 36</A>);

 for his sufferings for us were <I>his glory.</I>

 [2.] Now he answered to the type of Abraham's ram that was <I>caught in
 the thicket,</I> and so offered up instead of Isaac, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:13">Gen. xxii. 13</A>.

 [3.] Thorns signify afflictions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+33:11">2 Chron. xxxiii. 11</A>.

 These Christ put into a <I>crown;</I> so much did he alter the property 
 of them to them that are his, giving them cause to <I>glory in 
 tribulation,</I> and making it to work for them a weight of glory. 

 [4.] Christ was crowned with thorns, to show that <I>his kingdom was 
 not of this world,</I> nor the glory of it worldly glory, but is 
 attended here with bonds and afflictions, while the glory of it is 
 <I>to be revealed.</I> 

 [5.] It was the custom of some heathen nations, to bring their 
 sacrifices to the altars, crowned with garlands; these thorns were the 
 garlands with which this great Sacrifice was crowned.

 [6.] these thorns, it is likely, fetched blood from his blessed head, 
 which trickled down his face, <I>like the previous ointment</I> 
 (typifying the blood of Christ with which he consecrated himself) 
 <I>upon the head, which ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's 
 beard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+133:2">Ps. cxxxiii. 2</A>.

 Thus, when he came to espouse to himself his love, his dove, his
 undefiled church, his <I>head was filled with dew,</I> and his <I>locks 
 with the drops of the night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:2">Cant. v. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They <I>put a reed in his right hand;</I> this was intended for a 
 <I>mock-sceptre,</I> another of the <I>insignia</I> of the majesty they 
 jeered him with; as if this were a sceptre good enough for such a King, 
 as was like <I>a reed shaken with the wind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:7"><I>ch.</I> xi. 7</A>);

 like sceptre, like kingdom, both weak and wavering, and withering and 
 worthless; but they were quite mistaken, for his throne is <I>for ever 
 and ever,</I> and the <I>sceptre of his kingdom is a right sceptre,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:6">Ps. xlv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) <I>They bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, 
 King of the Jews!</I> Having made him a sham King, they thus make a 
 jest of doing homage to him, thus ridiculing his pretensions to 
 sovereignty, as Joseph's brethren 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:8">Gen. xxxvii. 8</A>);

 <I>Shalt thou indeed reign over us?</I> But as they were afterward 
 compelled to do obeisance to him, and enrich his dreams, so these here 
 bowed the knee, in scorn to him who was, soon after this, exalted to 
 the right hand of God, that <I>at his name every knee might bow,</I> or 
 break before him; it is ill jesting with that which, sooner or later, 
 will come in earnest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) They <I>spit upon him;</I> thus he had been abused in the High
 Priest's hall, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:67"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 67</A>.

 In doing homage, the subject kissed the sovereign, in token of his 
 allegiance; thus Samuel kissed Saul, and we are bid to <I>kiss the 
 Son:</I> but they, in this mock-homage, instead of kissing him, spit in 
 his face; that blessed face which outshines the sun, and before which 
 the angels cover theirs, was thus polluted. It is strange that the sons 
 of men should ever do such a piece of <I>villany,</I> and that the Son 
 of God should ever <I>suffer</I> such a piece of <I>ignominy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) They <I>took the reed, and smote him on the head.</I> That which
 they had made the <I>mock-ensign</I> of his royalty, they now make the 
 real instrument of <I>their</I> cruelty, and <I>his pain.</I> They 
 smote him, it is probable, upon the <I>crown of thorns,</I> and so 
 struck them into his head, that they might wound it the deeper, which 
 made the more sport for them, to whom his pain was the greatest 
 pleasure. Thus was he <I>despised and rejected of men; a man of 
 sorrows, and acquainted with grief.</I> All this misery and shame he 
 underwent, that he might purchase for us everlasting life, and joy, and 
 glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The conveying of him to the place of execution. After they had 
 mocked and abused him, as long as they thought fit, they then <I>took 
 the robe off from him;</I> to signify their divesting him of all the 
 kingly authority they had invested him with, by putting it on him; and 
 they put his own raiment on him, because that was to fall to the 
 soldiers' share, that were employed in the execution. They took off the 
 robe, but no mention is made of their taking off the <I>crown of 
 thorns,</I> whence it is commonly supposed (though there is no 
 certainty of it) that he was crucified with that on his head; for as he 
 is a Priest upon his throne, so he was a King upon his cross. Christ 
 was led to be crucified in <I>his own raiment,</I> because he himself 
 was to <I>bear our sins in his own body upon the tree.</I> And 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They <I>led him away</I> to be <I>crucified;</I> he was led <I>as a 
 lamb to the slaughter,</I> as a sacrifice to the altar. We may well 
 imagine how they hurried him on, and dragged him along, with all the 
 speed possible, lest any thing should intervene to prevent the glutting 
 of their cruel rage with his precious blood. It is probable that they 
 now loaded him with taunts and reproaches, and treated him as the 
 off-scouring of all things. They led him away <I>out of the city;</I> 
 for Christ, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, 
 <I>suffered without the gate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:12">Heb. xiii. 12</A>),

 as if he that was the glory of them that <I>waited for redemption</I> 
 in Jerusalem was not worthy to live among them. To this he himself had 
 an eye, when in the parable he speaks of his being <I>cast out of the 
 vineyard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:39"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 39</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They compelled Simon of Cyrene <I>to bear his cross,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 It seems, at first he <I>carried the cross</I> himself, as Isaac 
 carried the wood for the burnt-offering, which was to burn him. And 
 this was intended, as other things, both for pain and shame to him. But 
 after a while they <I>took the cross</I> off from him, either,

 (1.) In compassion to him, because they saw it was too great a load for
 him. We can hardly think that they had any consideration of that, yet 
 it teaches us that God <I>considers the frame</I> of his people, and 
 will not <I>suffer them to be tempted above what they are able;</I> he 
 gives them some breathing-time, but they must expect that the cross 
 will return, and the lucid intervals only give them space to prepare 
 for the next fit. But, 

 (2.) Perhaps it was because he could not, with the cross on his back, 
 go forward so fast as they would have him. Or, 

 (3.) They were afraid, lest he should faint away under the load of his 
 cross, and die, and so prevent what their malice further intended to do 
 against him: thus even the <I>tender mercies of the wicked</I> (which 
 seem to be so) <I>are</I> really <I>cruel.</I> Taking the cross off 
 from him, they <I>compelled</I> one Simon of Cyrene to bear it, 
 pressing him to the service by the authority of the governor or the 
 priests. It was a reproach, and none would do it but by compulsion.
 Some think that this Simon was a disciple of Christ, at least a 
 well-wisher to him, and that they knew it, and therefore put this upon 
 him. Note, All that will approve themselves disciples indeed, must 
 follow Christ, <I>bearing his cross</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:24"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 24</A>),

 <I>bearing his reproach,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:13">Heb. xiii. 13</A>.

 We must know the <I>fellowship of his sufferings for us,</I> and 
 patiently submit to all the sufferings for him we are called out to; 
 for those only shall <I>reign with him,</I> that <I>suffer with 
 him;</I> shall sit with him in his kingdom, that drink of <I>his 
 cup,</I> and are baptized with <I>his baptism.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>33  And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that
 is to say, a place of a skull,
 &nbsp; 34  They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when
 he had tasted <I>thereof,</I> he would not drink.
 &nbsp; 35  And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting
 lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
 They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they
 cast lots.
 &nbsp; 36  And sitting down they watched him there;
 &nbsp; 37  And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS
 JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
 &nbsp; 38  Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the
 right hand, and another on the left.
 &nbsp; 39  And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
 &nbsp; 40  And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest
 <I>it</I> in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come
 down from the cross.
 &nbsp; 41  Likewise also the chief priests mocking <I>him,</I> with the
 scribes and elders, said,
 &nbsp; 42  He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King
 of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
 believe him.
 &nbsp; 43  He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have
 him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 44  The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the
 same in his teeth.
 &nbsp; 45  Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
 unto the ninth hour.
 &nbsp; 46  And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
 saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my
 God, why hast thou forsaken me?
 &nbsp; 47  Some of them that stood there, when they heard <I>that,</I> said,
 This <I>man</I> calleth for Elias.
 &nbsp; 48  And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and
 filled <I>it</I> with vinegar, and put <I>it</I> on a reed, and gave him to
 drink.
 &nbsp; 49  The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
 save him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The place where our Lord Jesus was put to death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They came to a place called <I>Golgotha,</I> near adjoining to 
 Jerusalem, probably the common place of execution. If he had had a 
 house of his own in Jerusalem, probably, for his greater disgrace, they 
 would have crucified him before his own door. But now in the same
 place where criminals were sacrificed to the justice of the government, 
 was our Lord Jesus sacrificed to the justice of God. Some think that it 
 was called <I>the place of a skull,</I> because it was the common 
 charnel-house, where the bones and skulls of dead men were laid 
 together out of the way, lest people should touch them, and be defiled 
 thereby. Here lay the trophies of death's victory over multitudes of 
 the children of men; and when by dying Christ would destroy death, he 
 added this circumstance of honour to his victory, that he triumphed 
 over death upon his own dunghill.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There they <I>crucified</I> him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 nailed his hands and feet to the cross, and then reared it up, and him 
 hanging on it; for so the manner of the Romans was to crucify. Let our 
 hearts be touched with the feeling of that exquisite pain which our 
 blessed Saviour now endured, and let us look upon him who was thus 
 pierced, and mourn. Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? And when we 
 behold what manner of death he died, let us in that behold with <I>what 
 manner of love</I> he <I>loved us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The barbarous and abusive treatment they gave him, in which their 
 wit and malice vied which should excel. As if death, so great a death, 
 were not bad enough, they contrived to add to the bitterness and terror 
 of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By the drink they provided for him before he was nailed to the 
 cross, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 It was usual to have a cup of spiced wine for those to drink of, that 
 were to be put to death, according to Solomon's direction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:6,7">Prov. xxxi. 6, 7</A>),

 <I>Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish;</I> but with that 
 cup which Christ was to drink of, they mingled <I>vinegar and gall,</I> 
 to make it sour and bitter. This signified, 

 (1.) The <I>sin of man,</I> which is a <I>root of bitterness, bearing 
 gall and wormwood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:18">Deut. xxix. 18</A>.

 The sinner perhaps rolls it under his tongue as a sweet morsel, but to 
 God it is <I>grapes of gall,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:32">Deut. xxxii. 32</A>.

 It was so to the Lord Jesus, when he bare our sins, and sooner or later 
 it will be so to the sinner himself, <I>bitterness at the latter end, 
 more bitter than death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:26">Eccl. vii. 26</A>.

 (2.) It signified the <I>wrath of God,</I> that cup which is Father
 <I>put into his hand,</I> a bitter cup indeed, like the <I>bitter water 
 which caused the curse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+5:18">Num. v. 18</A>.

 This drink they offered him, as was literally foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:21">Ps. lxix. 21</A>.

 And,

 [1.] He <I>tasted thereof,</I> and so had the <I>worst</I> of it, took
 the bitter taste into his mouth; he let no bitter cup go by him 
 untasted, when he was making atonement for all our sinful tasting of 
 forbidden fruit; now he was <I>tasting</I> death in its full 
 bitterness. 

 [2.] He <I>would not drink it,</I> because he would not have the 
 <I>best of it;</I> would have nothing like an opiate to lessen his 
 sense of pain, for he would die so as to <I>feel himself die,</I> 
 because he had so much <I>work</I> to <I>do,</I> as our High Priest, in 
 his suffering work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By the dividing of his garments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 When they nailed him to the cross, they <I>stripped</I> him of his 
 garments, at least his <I>upper garments;</I> for by sin we were made 
 naked, to our shame, and thus he purchased for us white raiment to 
 cover us. If we be at any time stripped of our comforts for Christ, let 
 us bear it patiently; he was stripped for us. Enemies may strip us of 
 our <I>clothes,</I> but cannot strip us of our <I>best comforts;</I> 
 cannot take from us the <I>garments of praise.</I> The clothes of those 
 that are executed are the executioner's fee: four soldiers were 
 employed in crucifying Christ, and they must each of them have a share: 
 his upper garment, if it were divided, would be of no use to any of 
 them, and therefore they agreed to <I>cast lots</I> for it.

 (1.) Some think that the garment was so fine and rich, that it was 
 worth contending for; but that agreed not with the poverty Christ 
 appeared in. 

 (2.) Perhaps they had heard of those that had been cured by touching 
 the hem of his garment, and they thought it valuable for some magic 
 virtue in it. Or, 

 (3.) They hoped to get money of his friends for such a sacred relic. 
 Or, 

 (4.) Because, in derision, they would seem to put a value upon it, as 
 royal clothing. Or,

 (5.) It was for diversion; to pass away the time while they waited for 
 his death, they would play a game at dice for the clothes; but, 
 whatever they designed, the word of God is herein accomplished. In that 
 famous <I>psalm,</I> the first words of which Christ made use of upon 
 the cross, it was said, <I>They parted my garments among them, and cast 
 lots upon my vesture,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:18">Ps. xxii. 18</A>.

 This was never true of David, but looks <I>primarily</I> at Christ, of
 whom David, in spirit, spoke. Then is the offence of this part of the
 cross ceased; for it appears to have been by the <I>determinate counsel 
 and foreknowledge of God.</I> Christ stripped himself of his glories, 
 to divide them among us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 They now <I>sat down, and watched him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 The chief priests were careful, no doubt, in setting this guard, lest 
 the people, whom they still stood in awe of, should rise, and rescue 
 him. But Providence so ordered it, that those who were appointed to 
 <I>watch</I> him, thereby became unexceptionable witnesses for him; 
 having the opportunity to see and hear that which extorted from them 
 that noble confession

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),
 
 <I>Truly this was the Son of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. By the <I>title</I> set up over his head, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 It was usual for the vindicating of public justice, and putting the 
 greater shame upon malefactors that were executed, not only by a crier 
 to proclaim before them, but by a writing also over their heads to 
 notify what was the crime for which they suffered; so they set up over 
 Christ's head his accusation written, to give public notice of the 
 charge against him; <I>This is Jesus the King of the Jews.</I> This 
 they designed for his reproach, but God so overruled it, that even his 
 accusation redounded to his honour. For,

 (1.) Here was no crime alleged against him. It is not said that he was 
 a pretended Saviour, or a usurping King, though they would have it 
 thought so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:21">John xix. 21</A>);

 but, <I>This is Jesus, a Saviour;</I> surely that was no crime; and, 
 <I>This is the King of the Jews;</I> nor was that a crime; for they 
 expected that the Messiah should be so: so that, his enemies themselves 
 being judges, he <I>did no evil.</I> Nay, 

 (2.) Here was a very glorious truth asserted concerning him--that he is 
 <I>Jesus the King of the Jews,</I> that King whom the Jews expected and 
 ought to have submitted to; so that his accusation amounts to this, 
 That he was the true Messiah and Saviour of the world; as Balaam, when 
 he was sent for to curse Israel, blessed them all together, and that 
 three times 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:10">Num. xxiv. 10</A>),

 so Pilate, instead of accusing Christ as a Criminal, proclaimed him a 
 <I>King,</I> and that <I>three times,</I> in three inscriptions. Thus
 God makes men to serve <I>his</I> purposes, quite beyond <I>their 
 own.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. By his companions with him in suffering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 There were <I>two thieves crucified with him</I> at the same time, in 
 the same place, under the same guard; two highway-men, or robbers upon 
 the road, as the word properly signifies. It is probable that this was 
 appointed to be <I>execution-day;</I> and therefore they hurried the 
 prosecution of Christ in the morning, that they might have him ready to 
 be executed with the other criminals. Some think that Pilate ordered it 
 thus, that this piece of necessary justice, in executing these thieves, 
 might atone for his injustice in condemning Christ; others, that the 
 Jews contrived it, to add to the ignominy of the sufferings of our Lord 
 Jesus; however it was, the scripture was fulfilled in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:12">Isa. liii. 12</A>),
 
 <I>He was numbered with the transgressors.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was a reproach to him, that he was <I>crucified with them.</I> 
 Though, while he lived, he was <I>separate from sinners,</I> yet <I>in 
 their deaths they were not divided,</I> but he was made to partake with 
 the vilest malefactors in their plagues, as if he had been a partaker 
 with them in their sins; for he was made sin for us, and took upon him 
 the <I>likeness of sinful flesh.</I> He was, at his death, numbered 
 among the transgressors, and had his lot with the wicked, that we, at 
 our death, might be <I>numbered among the saints,</I> and have our 
 <I>lot among the chosen.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was an additional reproach, that he was crucified <I>in the 
 midst, between them,</I> as if he had been the worst of the three, the 
 principal malefactor; for among <I>three</I> the <I>middle</I> is the 
 place for the chief. Every circumstance was contrived to his dishonour, 
 as if the great Saviour were of all others the <I>greatest sinner.</I> 
 It was also intended to ruffle and discompose him, in his last moments, 
 with the shrieks, and groans, and blasphemies, of these malefactors, 
 who, it is likely, made a hideous outcry when they were nailed to the 
 cross; but thus would Christ affect himself with the miseries of 
 sinners, when he was suffering for their salvation. Some of Christ's 
 apostles were afterwards crucified, as Peter, and Andrew, but none of 
 them were crucified <I>with him,</I> lest it should have looked as if 
 they had been joint undertakers with him, in satisfying for man's sin, 
 and joint purchasers of life and glory; therefore he was crucified 
 between two malefactors, who could not be supposed to contribute any 
 thing to the merit of his death; for he himself bare our sins <I>in his 
 own body.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. By the blasphemies and revilings with which they loaded him when he 
 was hanging upon the cross; though we read not that they cast any 
 reflections on the thieves that were crucified with him. One would have 
 thought that, when they had nailed him to the cross, they had done 
 their worst, and malice itself had been exhausted: indeed if a criminal 
 be put into the pillory, or carted, because it is a punishment less 
 than death, it is usually attended with such expressions of abuse; but 
 a dying man, though an infamous man, should be treated with compassion. 
 It is an insatiable revenge indeed which will not be satisfied with 
 death, <I>so great a death.</I> But, to complete the humiliation of the 
 Lord Jesus, and to show that, when he was dying, he was <I>bearing 
 iniquity,</I> he was then <I>loaded with reproach,</I> and, for aught 
 that appears, not one of his friends, who the other day cried 
 <I>Hosanna</I> to him, durst be seen to show him any respect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The common <I>people, that passed by, reviled him.</I> His extreme 
 misery and exemplary patience under it, did not mollify them, or make 
 them to relent; but they who by their outcries brought him to this, now 
 think to justify themselves in it by their reproaches, as if they 
 <I>did well to condemn</I> him. They <I>reviled</I> him: 
 <B><I>eblasphemoun</I></B>--<I>they blasphemed</I> him; and
 <I>blasphemy</I> it was, in the strictest sense, speaking evil of him 
 who <I>thought it not robbery to be equal with God.</I> Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The persons that reviled him; <I>they that passed by,</I> the 
 travellers that went along the road, and it was a great <I>road,</I> 
 leading from Jerusalem to Gibeon; they were possessed with prejudices 
 against him by the reports and clamours of the High Priest's creatures. 
 It is a hard thing, and requires more application and resolution than 
 is ordinarily met with, to keep up a good opinion of persons and things 
 that are <I>every where</I> run down, and spoken against. Every one is 
 apt to say as the most say, and to throw a stone at that which is put 
 into an ill name. <I>Turba Remi sequitur fortunam semper et odit 
 damnatos--The Roman rabble fluctuate with a man's fluctuating fortunes,
 and fail not to depress those that are sinking.</I> Juvenal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The gesture they used, in contempt of him--<I>wagging their
 heads;</I> which signifies their triumph in his fall, and their 
 insulting over him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:22,Jer+18:16,La+2:15">Isa. xxxvii. 22;
 Jer. xviii. 16; Lam. ii. 15</A>.

 The language of it was, <I>Aha, so would we have it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:25">Ps. xxxv. 25</A>.
 
 Thus they insulted over him that was the Saviour of their country, as
 the Philistines did over Samson the destroyer of their country. This 
 very gesture was prophesied of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:7">Ps. xxii. 7</A>);

 <I>They shake the head at me.</I> And 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:25">Ps. cix. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The taunts and jeers they uttered. These are here recorded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> They upbraided him with his <I>destroying of the 
 temple.</I> Though the judges themselves were sensible that what he had 
 said of that was misrepresented (as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:59">Mark xiv. 59</A>),

 yet they industriously spread it among the people, to bring an 
 <I>odium</I> upon him, that he had a design to destroy the temple; than 
 which nothing would more <I>incense</I> the people against him. And 
 this was not the only time that the enemies of Christ had laboured to 
 <I>make others believe</I> that of religion and the people of God, 
 which they themselves have known to be <I>false,</I> and the charge 
 <I>unjust "Thou that destroyest the temple,</I> that vast and strong 
 fabric, try thy strength now in plucking up that <I>cross,</I> and 
 drawing those <I>nails,</I> and so <I>save thyself;</I> if thou hast 
 the power thou hast boasted of, this is a proper time to exert it, and 
 give proof of it; for it is supposed that every man will do his utmost 
 to <I>save himself.</I>" This made the cross of Christ such a 
 <I>stumbling-block</I> to the Jews, that they looked upon it to be 
 inconsistent with the <I>power</I> of the Messiah; he was <I>crucified 
 in weakness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:4">2 Cor. xiii. 4</A>),

 so it seemed to them; but indeed Christ crucified is the <I>Power of 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> They upbraided him with his saying that he was <I>the
 Son of God;</I> If thou be so, say they, <I>come down from the 
 cross.</I> Now they take the devil's words out of his mouth, with which 
 he tempted him in the wilderness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:3,6"><I>ch.</I> iv. 3, 6</A>),

 and renew the same assault; <I>If thou be the Son of God.</I> They 
 think that now, or never, he must prove himself to be the <I>Son of 
 God;</I> forgetting that he had proved it by the miracles he wrought, 
 particularly his raising of the dead; and unwilling to wait for the 
 complete proof of it by his own resurrection, to which he had so often 
 referred himself and them; which, if they had observed it, would have 
 anticipated the offence of the cross. This comes of judging things by 
 the present aspect of them, without a due remembrance of what is 
 <I>past,</I> and a patient expectation of <I>what may further be 
 produced.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>chief priests and scribes,</I> the church rulers, and the 
 <I>elders,</I> the state rulers, they mocked him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 They did not think it enough to invite the rabble to do it, but gave 
 Christ the dishonour, and themselves the diversion, or reproaching him 
 in their own proper persons. They should have been in the temple at 
 their devotion, for it was the first day of the feast of unleavened 
 bread, when there was to be a <I>holy convocation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:7">Lev. xxiii. 7</A>);

 but they were here at the place of execution, spitting their venom at 
 the Lord Jesus. How much below the grandeur and gravity of their 
 character was this! Could any thing tend more to make them 
 <I>contemptible and base before the people?</I> One would have thought, 
 that, though they neither feared God nor regarded man, yet common 
 prudence should have taught them who had so great a hand in Christ's 
 death, to keep as much as might be behind the curtain, and to play 
 least in sight; but nothing is so mean as that malice may stick at it. 
 Did they disparage themselves thus, to do despite to Christ, and shall 
 we be afraid of disparaging ourselves, by joining with the multitude to 
 <I>do him honour,</I> and not rather say, <I>If this be to be vile, I 
 will be yet more vile?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things the priests and elders upbraided him with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That he could not <I>save himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 He had been before abused in his prophetical and kingly office, and now 
 in his priestly office as a Saviour. <I>First,</I> They take it for 
 granted that he <I>could not</I> save himself, and therefore had not 
 the power he pretended to, when really he <I>would not</I> save 
 himself, because he would die to <I>save us.</I> They should have 
 argued, "He <I>saved others,</I> therefore he <I>could</I> save 
 himself, and if he do not, it is for some good reason." But, 
 <I>Secondly,</I> They would insinuate, that, because he did not now 
 save himself, therefore all his pretence to save others was but sham 
 and delusion, and was never really done; though the truth of his 
 miracles was demonstrated beyond contradiction. <I>Thirdly,</I> They 
 upbraid him with being <I>the King of Israel.</I> They dreamed of the 
 external pomp and power of the Messiah, and therefore thought <I>the 
 cross</I> altogether disagreeable to the King of Israel, and 
 inconsistent with that character. Many people would like the <I>King of 
 Israel</I> well enough, if he would but <I>come down from the 
 cross,</I> if they could have his kingdom without the tribulation 
 through which they must <I>enter into</I> it. But the matter is
 settled; if no cross, then no Christ, no crown. Those that would reign 
 with him, must be willing to suffer with him, for Christ and his cross 
 are <I>nailed together</I> in this world. <I>Fourthly,</I> They
 challenged him to <I>come down from the cross.</I> And what had become 
 of us then, and the work of our redemption and salvation? If he had 
 been provoked by these scoffs to <I>come down from the cross,</I> and 
 so to have left his undertaking <I>unfinished,</I> we had been for ever 
 <I>undone.</I> But his unchangeable love and resolution set him above, 
 and fortified him against, this temptation, so that he did not 
 <I>fail,</I> nor was <I>discouraged. Fifthly,</I> They promised that, 
 if he would <I>come down from the cross, they would believe him.</I> 
 Let him give them that proof of his being the Messiah, and they will 
 own him to be so. When they had formerly demanded a sign, he told them 
 that the sign he would give them, should be not his <I>coming down from 
 the cross,</I> but, which was a greater instance of his power, his 
 <I>coming up from the grave,</I> which they had not patience to wait 
 two or three days for. If he had <I>come down from the cross,</I> they
 might with as much reason have said that the soldiers had juggled in 
 nailing him to it, as they said, when he was raised from the dead, that 
 the <I>disciples came by night, and stole him away.</I> But to promise 
 ourselves that we would believe, if we had such and such means and 
 motives of faith as we ourselves would prescribe, when we do not 
 improve what God has appointed, is not only a gross instance of the 
 deceitfulness of our hearts, but the sorry <I>refuge,</I> or 
 <I>subterfuge</I> rather, of an obstinate destroying infidelity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That God, <I>his Father,</I> would <I>not save him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>);
 
 <I>He trusted in God,</I> that is, he pretended to do so; for he said, 
 <I>I am the Son of God.</I> Those who call God <I>Father,</I> and 
 themselves <I>his children,</I> thereby profess to put a confidence in 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:10">Ps. ix. 10</A>.

 Now they suggest, that he did but deceive himself and others, when he 
 made himself so much the <I>darling of heaven;</I> for, if he had been 
 the Son of God (as <I>Job's</I> friends argued concerning him), he 
 would not have been <I>abandoned to</I> all this misery, much less 
 <I>abandoned in</I> it. This was a <I>sword in his bones,</I> as David 
 complains of the like 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:10">Ps. xlii. 10</A>);

 and it was a <I>two-edged</I> sword, for it was intended, <I>First,</I> 
 To <I>vilify</I> him, and to make the standers-by think him a deceiver 
 and an impostor; as if his saying, that he was the <I>Son of God,</I> 
 were now effectually <I>disproved. Secondly,</I> To <I>terrify</I>
 him, and drive him to distrust and despair of his Father's power and 
 love; which some think, was the thing <I>he feared, religiously 
 feared,</I> prayed against, and was <I>delivered from,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.
 
 David complained more of the endeavours of his persecutors to <I>shake
 his faith,</I> and drive him from his hope in God, than of their
 attempts to <I>shake his throne,</I> and drive him from his kingdom;
 their saying, There is <I>no help for him in God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:2">Ps. iii. 2</A>),

 and, <I>God has forsaken him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:11">Ps. lxxi. 11</A>.

 In this, as in other things, he was a type of Christ. Nay, these very 
 words David, in that famous prophecy of Christ, mentions, as spoken by 
 <I>his enemies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:8">Ps. xxii. 8</A>);

 He <I>trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him.</I> Surely these
 priests and scribes had forgotten their psalter, or they would not have 
 used the same words, so exactly to answer the type and prophecy: but 
 the <I>scriptures must be fulfilled.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) To complete the reproach, the <I>thieves also that were crucified 
 with him</I> were not only not reviled as he was, as if they had been 
 saints compared with him, but, though fellow-sufferers with him, joined 
 in with his prosecutors, and <I>cast the same in his teeth;</I> that 
 is, one of them did, who said, <I>If thou be the Christ, save thyself 
 and us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:39">Luke xxiii. 39</A>.

 One would think that of all people this thief had <I>least cause,</I>
 and should have had <I>least mind,</I> to banter Christ. Partners in 
 suffering, though for different causes, usually commiserate one 
 another; and few, whatever they have done before, will breathe their 
 last in revilings. But, it seems, the greatest mortifications of the 
 body, and the most humbling rebukes of Providence, will not of 
 themselves mortify the corruptions of the soul, nor suppress the 
 wickedness of the wicked, without the grace of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Well, thus our Lord Jesus having undertaken to satisfy the justice of 
 God for the wrong done him in his honour by sin, he did it by suffering 
 <I>in his honour;</I> not only by divesting himself of that which was 
 due to him as the Son of God, but by submitting to the utmost indignity 
 that could be done to the worst of men; because he was made sin for us, 
 he was thus made a curse for us, to make reproach easy to us, if at any 
 time we suffer it, and have all manner of evil said against us falsely, 
 for righteousness' sake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have here the frowns of heaven, which our Lord Jesus was under, 
 in the midst of all these injuries and indignities from men. Concerning 
 which, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How this was signified--by an extraordinary and miraculous eclipse of
 the sun, which continued for <I>three hours,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 There was darkness <B><I>epi pasan ten gen</I></B>--<I>over all the 
 earth;</I> so most interpreters understand it, though our translation 
 confines it to <I>that land.</I> Some of the ancients appealed to the 
 annals of the nation concerning this extraordinary eclipse at the death 
 of Christ, as a thing well known, and which gave notice to those parts 
 of the world of something great then in doing; as the sun's going back 
 in Hezekiah's time did. It is reported that Dionysius, at Heliopolis in 
 Egypt, took notice of this darkness, and said, <I>Aut Deus natur&aelig; 
 patitur, aut mundi machina dissolvitur--Either the God of nature is 
 suffering, or the machine of the world is tumbling into ruin.</I> An 
 extraordinary light gave intelligence of the birth of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:2"><I>ch.</I> ii. 2</A>),

 and therefore it was proper that an extraordinary darkness should 
 notify his death, for he is the <I>Light of the world.</I> The 
 indignities done to our Lord Jesus, made the <I>heavens astonished,</I> 
 and <I>horribly afraid,</I> and even put them into disorder and 
 confusion; such wickedness as this the sun never saw before, and 
 therefore withdrew, and would not see this. This surprising, amazing, 
 darkness was designed to stop the mouths of those blasphemers, who were 
 reviling Christ as he hung on the cross; and it should seem that, for 
 the present, it struck such a terror upon them, that though their 
 hearts were not changed, yet they were silent, and stood doubting what 
 this should mean, till after <I>three hours</I> the darkness 
 <I>scattered,</I> and then (as appears by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>),

 like Pharaoh when the plague was over, they hardened their hearts. But 
 that which was principally intended in this darkness, was, 

 (1.) Christ's present <I>conflict</I> with the <I>powers of 
 darkness.</I> Now the prince of this world, and his forces, the 
 <I>rulers of the darkness of this world,</I> were to be cast out, to be 
 spoiled and vanquished; and to make his victory the more illustrious, 
 he fights them on their own ground; gives them all the advantage they 
 could have against him by this darkness, lets them take the <I>wind</I> 
 and <I>sun,</I> and yet baffles them, and so becomes more than a 
 conqueror.

 (2.) His present want of heavenly comforts. This darkness signified 
 that dark cloud which the human soul of our Lord Jesus was now under.
 God makes his sun to shine upon the just and upon the unjust; but even 
 the light of the sun was withheld from our Saviour, when he was <I>made 
 sin for us. A pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun;</I> 
 but because now his soul was exceeding sorrowful, and the cup of divine 
 displeasure was filled to him without mixture, even the light of the 
 sun was suspended. When earth denied him a drop of cold water, heaven 
 denied him a beam of light; having to deliver us from <I>utter 
 darkness,</I> he did himself, in the depth of his sufferings, walk in
 darkness, and had no light, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:10">Isa. l. 10</A>.

 During the <I>three hours</I> that this darkness continued, we do not 
 find that he said <I>one word,</I> but passed this time in a silent 
 retirement into his own soul, which was now in agony, wrestling with 
 the powers of darkness, and taking in the impressions of his Father's 
 displeasure, not against himself, but the sin of man, which he was now 
 <I>making his soul an offering for.</I> Never were there three such 
 hours since the day that God created man upon the earth, never such a 
 dark and awful scene; the <I>crisis</I> of that great affair of man's 
 redemption and salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he complained of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>);

 <I>About the ninth hour,</I> when it began to clear up, after a long
 and silent conflict. <I>Jesus cried, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</I> 
 The words are related in the Syriac tongue, in which they were spoken, 
 because worthy of double remark, and for the sake of the perverse 
 construction which his enemies put upon them, in putting <I>Elias</I> 
 for <I>Eli.</I> Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Whence he borrowed this complaint--from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:1">Ps. xxii. 1</A>.

 It is not probable (as some have thought) that he repeated the whole
 psalm; yet hereby he intimated that the whole was to be applied to him, 
 and that David, in spirit, there spoke of his humiliation and 
 exaltation. This, and that other word, <I>Into thy hands I commit my 
 spirit,</I> he fetched from David's psalms (though he could have 
 expressed himself in his own words), to teach us of what use the word 
 of God is to us, to direct us in prayer, and to recommend to us the use 
 of scripture-expressions in prayer, which will <I>help our 
 infirmities.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he uttered it--<I>with a loud voice;</I> which bespeaks the
 extremity of his pain and anguish, the strength of nature remaining in 
 him, and the great earnestness of his spirit in this expostulation. Now 
 the scripture was fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:15,16">Joel iii. 15, 16</A>);

 <I>The sun and the moon shall be darkened. The Lord shall also roar out 
 of Zion, and utter his voice form Jerusalem.</I> David often speaks of 
 his <I>crying aloud</I> in prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:17">Ps. lv. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What the complaint was--<I>My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken
 me?</I> A strange complaint to come from the mouth of our Lord Jesus, 
 who, we are sure, was <I>God's elect, in whom his soul delighted</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>),

 and one in whom he was always <I>well pleased.</I> The Father now loved 
 him, nay, he knew that <I>therefore he loved him, because he laid down 
 his life for the sheep;</I> what, and yet forsaken of him, and in the 
 midst of his sufferings too! Surely never sorrow was like unto that 
 sorrow which extorted such a complaint as this from one who, being 
 perfectly free from sin, could never be a terror to himself; but the 
 heart knows its own bitterness. No wonder that such a complaint as this 
 made the earth to quake, and rent the rocks; for it is enough to make 
 both the <I>ears of every one that hears it to tingle,</I> and ought to 
 be spoken of with great reverence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 [1.] That our Lord Jesus was, in his sufferings, for a time, 
 <I>forsaken by his Father.</I> So he saith himself, who we are sure was 
 under no mistake concerning his own case. Not that the union between 
 the divine and human nature was in the least weakened or shocked; no, 
 he was <I>now by the eternal Spirit offering himself:</I> nor as if 
 there were any abatement of his Father's love to him, or his to his 
 Father; we are sure that there was upon his mind no horror of God, or 
 despair of his favour, nor any thing of the torments of hell; but his 
 Father forsook him; that is, <I>First,</I> He delivered him up into the 
 hands of his enemies, and did not appear to deliver him out of their 
 hands. He let loose the powers of darkness against him, and suffered 
 them to do their worst, worse than against Job. Now was that scripture 
 fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:11">Job xvi. 11</A>),

 <I>God hath turned me over into the hands of the wicked;</I> and no 
 angel is sent from heaven to deliver him, no friend on earth raised up 
 to appear for him. <I>Secondly,</I> He withdrew from him the present 
 comfortable sense of his complacency in him. When <I>his soul</I> was 
 first <I>troubled,</I> he had a <I>voice from heaven</I> to comfort him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:27">John xii. 27, 28</A>);

 when he was in his agony in the garden, there appeared an angel from 
 heaven strengthening him; but now he had neither the one nor the other. 
 God hid his face from him, and for awhile withdrew his rod and staff in 
 the darksome valley. God <I>forsook</I> him, not as he forsook Saul, 
 leaving him to an endless despair, but as sometimes he forsook David, 
 leaving him to a present despondency. <I>Thirdly,</I> He let out upon 
 his soul an afflicting sense of his wrath against man for sin. Christ 
 was made <I>Sin</I> for us, a <I>Curse</I> for us; and therefore, 
 though God loved him as a Son, he frowned upon him as a Surety. These 
 impressions he was pleased to <I>admit,</I> and to <I>waive</I> that 
 <I>resistance</I> of them which he <I>could have made;</I> because he 
 would accommodate himself to this part of his undertaking, as he had 
 done to all the rest, when it was in his power to have avoided it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That Christ's being <I>forsaken</I> of his Father was the most 
 grievous of his sufferings, and that which he complained most of. Here 
 he laid the most doleful accents; he did not say, "Why am I scourged? 
 And why spit upon? And why nailed to the cross?" Nor did he say to his 
 disciples, when they turned their back upon him, <I>Why have ye 
 forsaken me?</I> But when his Father stood at a distance, he cried out 
 thus; for this as it that <I>put wormwood and gall</I> into the 
 affliction and misery. This brought the <I>waters into the soul,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:1-3">Ps. lxix. 1-3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] That our Lord Jesus, even when he was thus forsaken of his Father, 
 kept hold of him as his God, notwithstanding; <I>My God, my God;</I> 
 though forsaking me, yet <I>mine.</I> Christ was God's <I>servant</I> 
 in carrying on the work of redemption, to him he was to make 
 satisfaction, and by him to be carried through and crowned, and upon 
 that account he calls him <I>his God;</I> for he was now <I>doing his 
 will.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:5-9">Isa. xlix. 5-9</A>.

 This supported him, and bore him up, that even in the depth of his
 sufferings God was his God, and this he resolves to keep fast hold 
 of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) See how his enemies impiously bantered and ridiculed this 
 complaint 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>);

 <I>They said, This man calleth for Elias.</I> Some think that this was 
 the ignorant mistake of the Roman soldiers, who had heard talk of 
 Elias, and of the Jews' expectation of the coming of Elias, but knew 
 not the signification of <I>Eli, Eli,</I> and so made this blundering 
 comment upon these words of Christ, perhaps not hearing the latter part 
 of what he said, for the noise of the people. Note, Many of the 
 reproaches cast upon the word of God and the people of God, take rise 
 from gross mistakes. Divine truths are often corrupted by ignorance of 
 the language and style of the scripture. Those that hear by the halves, 
 pervert what they hear. But others think that it was the wilful mistake 
 of some of the Jews, who knew very well what he said, but were disposed 
 to abuse him, and make themselves and their companions merry, and to 
 misrepresent him as one who, being forsaken of God, was driven to trust 
 in creatures; perhaps hinting also, that he who had pretended to be 
 himself the Messiah, would now be glad to be beholden to Elias, who was 
 expected to be only the harbinger and forerunner of the Messiah. Note, 
 It is no new thing for the most pious devotions of the best men to be 
 ridiculed and abused by profane scoffers; nor are we to think it 
 strange if what is well said in praying and preaching be misconstrued, 
 and turned to our reproach; Christ's words were so, though he spoke as 
 never man spoke.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The cold comfort which his enemies ministered to him in this agony, 
 which was like all the rest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Some <I>gave him vinegar to drink</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>);

 instead of some cordial-water to revive and refresh him under this 
 heavy burthen, they tantalized him with that which did not only add to 
 the reproach they were loading him with, but did too sensibly represent 
 that cup of trembling which his Father had <I>put into his hand. One of 
 them ran</I> to fetch it, seeming to be officious to him, but really 
 glad of an opportunity to abuse and affront him, and afraid lest any 
 one should take it out of his hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Others, which the same purpose of disturbing and abusing him, refer 
 him to Elias 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>);

 "<I>Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</I> Come, 
 let him alone, his case is desperate, neither heaven nor earth can help 
 him; let us do nothing either to hasten his death, or to retard it; he 
 has appealed to Elias, and <I>to Elias let him go.</I>"</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>50  Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up
 the ghost.
 &nbsp; 51  And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from
 the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks
 rent;
 &nbsp; 52  And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints
 which slept arose,
 &nbsp; 53  And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went
 into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
 &nbsp; 54  Now when the centurion, and they that were with him,
 watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were
 done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 55  And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
 Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
 &nbsp; 56  Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James
 and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, at length, an account of the death of Christ, and several 
 remarkable passages that attended it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>manner</I> how he breathed his last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>);

 between the third and the sixth hour, that is, between nine and twelve 
 o'clock, as we reckon, he was nailed to the cross, and soon after the 
 ninth hour, that is, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, 
 he <I>died.</I> That was the time of the offering of the evening 
 sacrifice, and the time when the paschal lamb was killed; and Christ 
 our Passover was sacrificed for us and offered himself in the evening 
 of the world a sacrifice to God of a sweet-smelling savour. It was at 
 that time of the day, that the angel Gabriel delivered to Daniel that 
 glorious prediction of the Messiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21,24">Dan. ix. 21, 24</A>,

 &c. And some think that from that very time when the angel spoke it, to
 this time when Christ died, was just seventy weeks, that is, four
 hundred and ninety years to a day, to an hour; as the departure of
 <I>Israel</I> out of Egypt was at the end of the four hundred and
 thirty years, <I>even the self-same day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:41">Exod. xii. 41</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things are here noted concerning the manner of Christ's dying.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he <I>cried with a loud voice,</I> as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This was a sign, that, after all his pains and fatigues, his life 
 was <I>whole</I> in him, and nature <I>strong.</I> The voice of dying 
 men is one of the first things that fails; with a panting breath and a 
 faltering tongue, a few broken words are hardly spoken, and more hardly 
 heard. But Christ, just before he expired, spoke like a man <I>in his 
 full strength,</I> to show that his life was not forced from him, but 
 was freely <I>delivered</I> by him into his Father's hands, as <I>his 
 own act and deed.</I> He that had strength to cry thus when he died, 
 could have got loose from the arrest he was under, and have bid 
 defiance to the powers of death; but to show that <I>by the eternal 
 Spirit he offered himself,</I> being the Priest as well as the 
 Sacrifice, he <I>cried with a loud voice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was significant. This <I>loud voice</I> shows that he attacked 
 our spiritual enemies with an undaunted courage, and such a bravery of 
 resolution as bespeaks him hearty in the cause and daring in the 
 encounter. He was now <I>spoiling principalities and powers,</I> and in 
 this loud voice he did, as it were, <I>shout for mastery,</I> as one
 <I>mighty to save,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:1">Isa. lxiii. 1</A>.

 Compare with this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:13,14">Isa. lxxii. 13, 14</A>.

 He now bowed himself with all his might, as Samson did, when he said,
 <I>Let me die with the Philistines,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:30">Judg. xvi. 30</A>.

 <I>Animamque in vulnere ponit--And lays down his life.</I> His crying
 with a loud voice when he died, signified that his death should be 
 published and proclaimed to all the world; all mankind being concerned 
 in it, and obliged to take notice of it. Christ's loud cry was like a 
 trumpet blown over the sacrifices.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That then he <I>yielded up the ghost.</I> This is the usual 
 periphrasis of dying; to show that the Son of God upon the cross did 
 truly and properly die by the violence of the pain he was put to. His 
 <I>soul</I> was separated from his <I>body,</I> and so his body was 
 left really and truly dead. It was certain that he <I>did die,</I> for 
 it was requisite that he should die; <I>thus it was written,</I> both 
 in the <I>close rolls</I> of the <I>divine counsels,</I> and in the 
 <I>letters patent of</I> the <I>divine predictions,</I> and therefore 
 thus <I>it behoved him to suffer.</I> Death being the penalty for the 
 breach of the first covenant (<I>Thou shalt surely die</I>), the 
 Mediator of the new covenant must make atonement <I>by means of 
 death,</I> otherwise no remission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:15">Heb. ix. 15</A>.

 He had undertaken to make his soul an <I>offering for sin;</I> and he
 did it, when he <I>yielded up the ghost,</I> and voluntarily resigned 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The miracles that attended his death. So many miracles being 
 wrought <I>by him</I> in his life, we might well expect some to be 
 wrought concerning him at his death, for his name was called 
 <I>Wonderful.</I> Had he been fetched away as Elijah in a <I>fiery 
 chariot,</I> that had itself been miracle enough; but, being sent for 
 away by an ignominious cross, it was requisite that his humiliation 
 should be attended with some signal emanations of the divine glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain.</I> This 
 relation is ushered in with <I>Behold;</I> "Turn aside, and see this 
 great sight, and be astonished at it." Just as our Lord Jesus expired, 
 at the time of the offering of the evening-sacrifice, and upon a solemn 
 day, when the priests were officiating in the temple, and might 
 themselves be eyewitnesses of it, <I>the veil of the temple was 
 rent</I> by an invisible power; that veil which parted between the 
 <I>holy place</I> and the <I>most holy.</I> They had condemned him for 
 saying, <I>I will destroy this temple,</I> understanding it literally; 
 now by this specimen of his power he let them know that, if he had 
 pleased, he could have made his words good. In this, as in others of 
 Christ's miracles, there was a mystery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was in correspondence with the temple of Christ's body, which 
 was now in the dissolving. This was the true temple, in which dwelt 
 <I>the fulness of the Godhead;</I> when Christ <I>cried with a loud 
 voice, and gave up the ghost,</I> and so dissolved that temple, the 
 literal temple did, as it were, echo to that cry, and answer the 
 stroke, by <I>rending its veil.</I> Note, Death is the rending of the 
 veil of flesh which interposes between us and the holy of holies; the 
 death of Christ was so, the death of true Christians is so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It signified the revealing and unfolding of the mysteries of the 
 Old Testament. The veil of the temple was for concealment, as was that 
 on the face of Moses, therefore it was called the <I>veil of the 
 covering;</I> for it was highly penal for any person to see the 
 furniture of the most holy place, except the High-Priest, and he but 
 once a year, with great ceremony and through a cloud of smoke; all 
 which signified the darkness of that dispensation; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13">2 Cor. iii. 13</A>.

 But now, at the death of Christ, all was laid open, the mysteries were
 unveiled, so that now he that runs may read the meaning of them. Now we 
 see that the mercy-seat signified <I>Christ</I> the great 
 <I>Propitiation;</I> the pot of <I>manna</I> signified Christ the Bread
 of life. Thus <I>we all with open face behold, as in a glass</I> (which
 helps the sight, as the veil hindered it), <I>the glory of the Lord. 
 Our eyes see the salvation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It signified the uniting of Jew and Gentile, by the removing of 
 the partition wall between them, which was the ceremonial law, by which 
 the Jews were distinguished from all other people (as a <I>garden 
 enclosed</I>), were brought near to God, while others were made to 
 <I>keep their distance.</I> Christ, in his death, repealed the 
 ceremonial law, cancelled that <I>hand-writing of ordinances,</I> took 
 it out of the way, nailed it to his cross, and so <I>broke down the 
 middle wall of partition;</I> and by abolishing those institutions 
 <I>abolished the enmity,</I> and <I>made in himself of twain one new 
 man</I> (as two rooms are made one, and that large and lightsome, by 
 taking down the partition), so <I>making peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14-16">Eph. ii. 14-16</A>.
 
 Christ died, to rend all dividing veils, and to make all his one,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21">John xvii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) It signified the consecrating and laying open of <I>a new and 
 living way</I> to God. The veil kept people off from drawing near to 
 the most holy place, where the <I>Shechinah</I> was. But the rending of 
 it signified that Christ by his death opened a way to God, 

 [1.] <I>For himself.</I> This was the great <I>day of atonement,</I> 
 when our Lord Jesus, as the great <I>High-Priest,</I> not <I>by the 
 blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, entered once for all 
 into the holy place;</I> in token of which the veil was rent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:7">Heb. ix. 7</A>,

 &c. Having offered his sacrifice in the outer court, the blood of it
 was now to be sprinkled upon the mercy-seat within the veil; wherefore 
 <I>lift up your heads, O ye gates,</I> and <I>be ye lift up, ye 
 everlasting doors; for the King of glory,</I> the Priest of glory, 
 <I>shall come in.</I> Now was he caused to draw near, and made to 
 approach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">Jer. xxx. 21</A>.

 Though he did not personally ascend into the holy place not made with
 hands till above forty days after, yet he immediately acquired a right 
 to enter, and had a virtual admission.

 [2.] <I>For us in him:</I> so the apostle applies it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:19,20">Heb. x. 19, 20</A>.
 
 We have <I>boldness to enter into the holiest, by that new and living
 way which he has consecrated for us through the veil.</I> He died, to
 <I>bring us to God,</I> and, in order thereunto, to rend that veil of
 guilt and wrath which interposed between us and him, to take away the
 <I>cherubim</I> and <I>flaming sword,</I> and to open the way to <I>the
 tree of life.</I> We have free access through Christ to the throne of
 grace, or mercy-seat, now, and to the throne of glory hereafter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:16,6:20">Heb. iv. 16; vi. 20</A>.

 The rending of the veil signified (as that ancient hymn excellently
 expresses it), that, <I>when Christ had overcome the sharpness of 
 death, he opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.</I> Nothing 
 can obstruct or discourage our access to heaven, for the veil is rent; 
 <I>a door is opened in heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:1">Rev. iv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>earth did quake;</I> not only mount Calvary, where Christ was 
 crucified, but the <I>whole land,</I> and the adjacent countries. This 
 earthquake signified two things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>horrible</I> wickedness of <I>Christ's crucifiers.</I> The 
 earth, by trembling under such a load, bore its testimony to the 
 innocency of him that was persecuted, and against the impiety of those 
 that persecuted him. Never did the whole creation, before, groan under 
 such a burthen as the Son of God crucified, and the guilty wretches 
 that crucified him. The earth <I>quaked,</I> as if it <I>feared to open 
 its mouth</I> to <I>receive</I> the blood of Christ, so much more 
 precious than that of Abel, which it had received, and was 
 <I>cursed</I> for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:11,12">Gen. iv. 11, 12</A>);

 and as if it <I>fain would open its mouth,</I> to swallow up those 
 rebels that put him to death, as it had swallowed up Dathan and Abiram 
 for a much less crime. When the prophet would express God's great 
 displeasure against the wickedness of the wicked, he asks, <I>Shall not 
 the land tremble for this?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:8">Amos viii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>glorious</I> achievements of <I>Christ's cross.</I> This 
 <I>earthquake</I> signified the mighty shock, nay, the fatal blow, now 
 given to the devil's kingdom. So vigorous was the assault Christ now 
 made upon the infernal powers, that (as of old, <I>when he went out of 
 Seir, when he marched through the field of Edom</I>) the <I>earth 
 trembled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:4,Ps+68:7,8">Judg. v. 4; Ps. lxviii. 7, 8</A>.

 God shakes all nations, when the Desire of all nations is to come; and
 there is a <I>yet once more,</I> which perhaps refers to this shaking,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:6,21">Hag. ii. 6, 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The <I>rocks rent;</I> the hardest and firmest part of the earth was 
 made to feel this mighty shock. Christ had said, that if the children 
 should cease to cry <I>Hosanna, the stones would immediately cry 
 out;</I> and now, in effect, they did so, proclaiming the glory of the 
 suffering Jesus, and themselves more sensible of the wrong done him 
 than the hard-hearted Jews were, who yet will shortly be glad to find a 
 <I>hole in the rocks, and a cleft in the ragged rocks,</I> to hide them 
 from the face of him that sitteth on the throne. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:16,Isa+2:21">Rev. vi. 16; Isa. ii. 21</A>.

 But when God's <I>fury is poured out like fire, the rocks are thrown
 down by him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:6">Nah. i. 6</A>.

 Jesus Christ is <I>the Rock;</I> and the rending of <I>these</I> rocks, 
 signified the rending of <I>that</I> rock,

 (1.) That in the clefts of it was may be <I>hid,</I> as Moses in the
 cleft of the rock at Horeb, that there we may <I>behold the glory of 
 the Lord,</I> as he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:22">Exod. xxxiii. 22</A>.

 Christ's dove is said to be <I>hid in the clefts of the rock</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:14">Cant. ii. 14</A>),

 that is, as some make the allusion, sheltered in the wounds of our Lord 
 Jesus, the Rock rent.

 (2.) That from the cleft of it rivers of living water may flow, and 
 follow us in this wilderness, as from the rock which Moses <I>smote</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:6">Exod. xvii. 6</A>),
 
 and which God clave 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:15">Ps. lxxviii. 15</A>);

 and <I>that rock was Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:4">1 Cor. x. 4</A>.

 When we celebrate the memorial of Christ's death, our hard and rocky 
 hearts must be <I>rent</I>--the heart, and not the garments. That heart 
 is harder than a rock, that will not <I>yield,</I> that will not 
 <I>melt,</I> where Jesus Christ is <I>evidently set forth 
 crucified.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The <I>graves were opened.</I> This matter is not related so fully 
 as our curiosity would wish; for the scripture was not intended to 
 gratify that; it should seem, that same earthquake that rent the rocks, 
 <I>opened the graves,</I> and many bodies of <I>saints which slept, 
 arose.</I> Death to the saints is but the <I>sleep</I> of the body, and 
 the <I>grave</I> the bed it <I>sleeps in;</I> they awoke by the power 
 of the Lord Jesus, and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>)

 came <I>out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into 
 Jerusalem, the holy city, and appeared unto many.</I> Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We may raise many enquiries concerning it, which we cannot 
 resolve: as, 

 [1.] <I>Who</I> these <I>saints</I> were, that <I>did arise.</I> Some 
 think, the <I>ancient patriarchs,</I> that were in such care to be 
 buried in the land of Canaan, perhaps in the believing foresight of the 
 advantage of this early resurrection. Christ had lately proved the 
 doctrine of the resurrection from the instance of the patriarchs 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:32"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 32</A>),

 and here was a speedy confirmation of his argument. Others think,
 these that arose were <I>modern saints,</I> such as had been Christ in 
 the flesh, but died before him; as his father Joseph, Zecharias, 
 Simeon, John Baptist, and others, that had been known to the disciples, 
 while they lived, and therefore were the fitter to be witnesses to them 
 in an <I>apparition</I> after. What if we should suppose that they were 
 the <I>martyrs,</I> who in the Old-Testament times had sealed the 
 truths of God with their blood, that were thus <I>dignified</I> and 
 <I>distinguished?</I> Christ particularly points at them as his 
 forerunners,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 35</A>.

 And we find
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:4,5">Rev. xx. 4, 5</A>),

 that those who were <I>beheaded for the testimony of Jesus,</I> arose 
 <I>before the rest of the dead.</I> Sufferers with Christ shall 
 <I>first</I> reign with him.

 [2.] It is uncertain whether (as some think) they arose to life, now at
 the death of Christ, and disposed of themselves elsewhere, but did not 
 <I>go into the city</I> till after his resurrection; or whether (as 
 others think), though <I>their sepulchres</I> (which the 
 <I>Pharisees</I> had <I>built</I> and <I>varnished,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:29"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 29</A>),

 and so made remarkable, were shattered now by the earthquake (so little
 did God regard that hypocritical respect), yet they did not 
 <I>revive</I> and <I>rise</I> till after the resurrection; only, for 
 brevity-sake, it is mentioned here, upon the mention of the <I>opening 
 of the graves,</I> which seems more probable.

 [3.] Some think that they arose only to bear witness of Christ's 
 resurrection to those to whom they appeared, and, having finished their 
 testimony, retired to their graves again. But it is more agreeable, 
 both to Christ's honour and theirs, to <I>suppose,</I> though we cannot 
 <I>prove,</I> that they arose as Christ did, to <I>die no more,</I> and 
 therefore ascended with him to glory. Surely on them who did partake of 
 his first resurrection, a <I>second</I> death had no power. 

 [4.] To whom they appeared (not <I>to all the people</I> it is certain, 
 but to <I>many</I>), whether enemies or friends, in what manner they 
 appeared, how often, what they said and did, and how they disappeared, 
 are secret things which belong not to us; we must not covet to be 
 <I>wise above what is written.</I> The relating of this matter so 
 briefly, is a plain intimation to us, that we must not look that way 
 for a confirmation of our faith; we have a more sure word of prophecy. 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:31">Luke xvi. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Yet we may learn many good lessons from it.

 [1.] That even those who lived and died before the death and 
 resurrection of Christ, had saving benefit thereby, as well as those 
 who have lived since; for he <I>was</I> the same <I>yesterday</I> that 
 he is <I>to-day,</I> and will be <I>for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:8">Heb. xiii. 8</A>.

 [2.] That Jesus Christ, by dying, conquered, disarmed, and disabled, 
 death. These saints that arose, were the present trophies of the 
 victory of Christ's cross over the powers of <I>death,</I> which he 
 thus <I>made a show of openly.</I> Having by death destroyed him that 
 had the power of death, he thus <I>led captivity captive,</I> and 
 gloried in these <I>re-taken prizes,</I> in them fulfilling that 
 scripture, <I>I will ransom them from the power of the grave.</I> 

 [3.] That, in virtue of Christ's resurrection, the bodies of all the 
 saints shall, in the fulness of time, <I>rise again.</I> This was an 
 earnest of the general resurrection at the last day, when <I>all that 
 are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.</I> And 
 perhaps Jerusalem is <I>therefore</I> called here the <I>holy city,</I> 
 because the saints, at the general resurrection, shall enter into the 
 <I>new Jerusalem;</I> which will be indeed what the other was in name 
 and type only, the <I>holy city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:2">Rev. xxi. 2</A>.

 [4.] That all the saints do, by the influence of Christ's death, and in 
 conformity to it, rise from the <I>death of sin</I> to the <I>life of 
 righteousness.</I> They are <I>raised up with him</I> to a divine and 
 spiritual life; they go <I>into the holy city,</I> become 
 <I>citizens</I> of it, have their conversation in it, and <I>appear to 
 many,</I> as persons not of this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The conviction of his enemies that were employed in the execution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),

 which some make no less than another miracle, all things considered. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The persons convinced; <I>the centurion, and they that were with him 
 watching Jesus;</I> a captain and his company, that were set on the 
 guard on this occasion. 

 (1.) They were <I>soldiers,</I> whose profession is commonly hardening, 
 and whose breasts are commonly not so susceptible as some others of the 
 impressions either of fear or pity. But there is no spirit too big,
 too bold, for the power of Christ to break and humble. 

 (2.) They ware <I>Romans, Gentiles,</I> who knew not the scriptures 
 which were now fulfilled; yet they only were convinced. A sad presage
 of the <I>blindness</I> that should <I>happen to Israel,</I> when the 
 gospel should be sent to the Gentiles, to open their eyes. Here were 
 the Gentiles <I>softened,</I> and the Jews <I>hardened.</I> 

 (3.) They were the persecutors of Christ, and those that but just 
 before had reviled him, as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:36">Luke xxiii. 36</A>.

 How soon can God, by the power he has over men's consciences, alter 
 their language, and fetch confessions of his truths, to his own glory, 
 out of the mouths of those that have <I>breathed</I> nothing but 
 <I>threatenings, and slaughter,</I> and blasphemies!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The means of their conviction; they perceived <I>the earthquake,</I> 
 which frightened them, and saw the other <I>things that were done.</I> 
 These were designed to assert the honour of Christ in his sufferings, 
 and had their end on these soldiers, whatever they had on others. Note, 
 The dreadful appearances of God in his providence sometimes work 
 strangely for the conviction and awakening of sinners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The expressions of this conviction, in two things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>terror</I> that was <I>struck</I> upon them; they <I>feared 
 greatly;</I> feared lest they should have been buried in the darkness, 
 or swallowed up in the earthquake. Note, God can easily frighten the 
 most daring of his adversaries, and make them know themselves to be but 
 men. Guilt puts men into fear. He that, when iniquity abounds, doth not 
 <I>fear always,</I> with a fear of <I>caution,</I> when judgments are 
 abroad, cannot but <I>fear greatly,</I> with a fear of 
 <I>amazement;</I> whereas there are those who will not fear, <I>though 
 the earth be removed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:1,2">Ps. xlvi. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>testimony</I> that was <I>extorted</I> from them; they 
 said, <I>Truly this was the Son of God;</I> a noble confession; Peter 
 was blessed for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:16,17"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 16, 17</A>.

 It was the great matter now in dispute, the point upon which he and his
 enemies had <I>joined issue,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26"63,64"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 63, 64</A>.

 His disciples believed it, but at this time durst not confess it; our
 Saviour himself was tempted to question it, when he said, <I>Why hast 
 thou forsaken me?</I> The Jews, now that he was dying upon the cross, 
 looked upon it as plainly determined against him, that he was not the 
 Son of God, because he did not come down from the cross. And yet now 
 this centurion and the soldiers make this voluntary confession of the 
 Christian faith, <I>Truly this was the Son of God.</I> The best of his 
 disciples could not have said more at any time, and at this time they 
 had not faith and courage enough to say thus much. Note, God can 
 maintain and assert the honour of a truth then when it seems to be 
 crushed, and run down; for <I>great is the truth, and will 
 prevail.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The attendance of his friends, that were witnesses of his death, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:55,56"><I>v.</I> 55, 56</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who they were; <I>many women who followed him from Galilee.</I> Not 
 his apostles (only elsewhere we find John by the cross, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:26">John xix. 26</A>),
 
 their hearts failed them, they durst not appear, for fear of coming
 under the same condemnation. But here were a company of women, some
 would have called them <I>silly</I> women, that <I>boldly</I> stuck to 
 Christ, when the rest of his disciples had basely deserted him. Note, 
 Even those of the weaker sex are often, by the grace of God, made 
 strong in faith, that Christ's strength may be made perfect in 
 weakness. There have been women martyrs, famous for courage and 
 resolution in Christ's cause. Now of these women it is said, 

 (1.) That they had <I>followed Jesus from Galilee,</I> out of the great 
 love they had to him, and a desire to hear him preach; otherwise, the 
 males only were obliged to come up, to worship at the feast. Now having 
 followed him such a long journey as from Galilee to Jerusalem, eighty 
 or a hundred miles, they resolved not to forsake him now. Note, Our 
 former services and sufferings for Christ should be an argument with 
 us, faithfully to persevere to the end in our attendance on him. Have 
 we followed him <I>so far</I> and so long, done so much, and laid out 
 so much for him, and shall we forsake him now? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:3,4">Gal. iii. 3, 4</A>.

 (2.) That they <I>ministered to him</I> of their substance, for his 
 necessary subsistence. How gladly would they have ministered to him 
 now, if they might have been admitted! But, being forbidden that, they 
 resolved to <I>follow him.</I> Note, When we are restrained from doing 
 what we <I>would,</I> we must do what we can, in the service of Christ. 
 Now that he is <I>in heaven,</I> though he is out of the reach of our 
 <I>ministration,</I> he is not out of the reach of our <I>believing 
 views.</I> 

 (3.) Some of them are particularly named; for God will <I>honour</I> 
 those that <I>honour</I> Christ. They were such as we have several 
 times met with <I>before,</I> and it was their praise, that we meet 
 with them <I>to the last.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What they did; they were <I>beholding afar off.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They stood <I>afar off.</I> Whether their own fear or their 
 enemies' fury kept them at a distance, is not certain; however, it was 
 an aggravation of the sufferings of Christ, that his <I>lovers and 
 friends stood aloof from his sore,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:11,Job+19:13">Ps. xxxviii. 11; Job xix. 13</A>.

 Perhaps they might have come nearer, if they would; but good people,
 when they are in sufferings, must not think it strange, if some of
 their best friends be shy of them. When Paul's danger was imminent,
 <I>no man stood by him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16">2 Tim. iv. 16</A>.

 If we be thus looked strangely upon, remember, our Master was so before
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They were there <I>beholding,</I> in which they showed a concern 
 and kindness for Christ; when they were debarred from doing any other 
 office of love to him, they looked a look of love toward him. 

 [1.] It was a <I>sorrowful</I> look; they looked unto him who was now 
 pierced, and <I>mourned;</I> and no doubt, were <I>in bitterness</I> 
 for him. We may well imagine how it cut them to the heart, to see him 
 in this torment; and what floods of tears it fetched from their eyes. 
 Let us with an eye of faith behold Christ and him crucified, and be 
 affected with that great love wherewith he loved us. But, 

 [2.] It was no more than a look; they beheld him, but they could not 
 <I>help him.</I> Note, When Christ was in his sufferings, the best of 
 his friends were but spectators and lookers on, even the <I>angelic 
 guards stood trembling by,</I> saith Mr. Norris, for he <I>trod the 
 wine-press alone,</I> and of the people there was none with him; so 
 <I>his own arm wrought salvation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>57  When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimath&aelig;a,
 named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:
 &nbsp; 58  He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
 commanded the body to be delivered.
 &nbsp; 59  And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
 linen cloth,
 &nbsp; 60  And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in
 the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
 sepulchre, and departed.
 &nbsp; 61  And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting
 over against the sepulchre.
 &nbsp; 62  Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,
 the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
 &nbsp; 63  Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he
 was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
 &nbsp; 64  Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
 third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away,
 and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last
 error shall be worse than the first.
 &nbsp; 65  Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make
 <I>it</I> as sure as ye can.
 &nbsp; 66  So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the
 stone, and setting a watch.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Christ's <I>burial,</I> and the manner and 
 circumstances of it, concerning which observe, 

 1. The <I>kindness</I> and <I>good will</I> of his friends that <I>laid
 him in the grave.</I>

 2. The <I>malice</I> and <I>ill will</I> of his enemies that were very
 solicitous to keep him there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His friends gave him a <I>decent burial.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general, that Jesus Christ was <I>buried;</I> when his precious 
 soul was gone to paradise, his blessed body was deposited in the 
 chambers of the grave, that he might answer the type of Jonas, and 
 fulfil the prophecy of Isaias; he <I>made his grave with the 
 wicked.</I> Thus in all things he must be made <I>like unto his 
 brethren,</I> sin only excepted, and, like us, unto dust <I>he must 
 return.</I> He was buried, to make his death the more certain, and his 
 resurrection the more illustrious. Pilate would not deliver his body
 to be buried, till he was well assured that he was really dead; while 
 the witnesses lay <I>unburied,</I> there were some hopes concerning 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:8">Rev. xi. 8</A>.

 But Christ, the great Witness, is as one <I>free among the dead, like 
 the slain that lie in the grave.</I> He was <I>buried,</I> that he 
 might take off the terror of the grave, and make it easy to us, might 
 warm and perfume that cold noisome bed for us, and that we might be 
 <I>buried with him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The particular circumstances of his burial here related.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The time <I>when</I> he was buried; <I>when the evening was 
 come;</I> the same evening that he died, before sun-set, as is usual in 
 burying malefactors. It was not deferred till the next day, because it 
 was <I>the sabbath;</I> for burying the dead is not proper work either 
 for a day of rest or for a day of rejoicing, as the sabbath is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The person that took care of the funeral was Joseph of Arimathea. 
 The apostles had all fled, and none of them appeared to show this 
 respect to their Master, which the disciples of John <I>showed</I> to 
 him after he was beheaded, who <I>took up his body, and buried it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:12"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 12</A>.

 The women that followed him durst not move in it; then did God stir up
 this good man to do it; for what work God has to do, he will find out 
 instruments to do it. Joseph was a fit man, for,

 [1.] He had wherewithal to do it, being a <I>rich man.</I> Most of 
 Christ's disciples were poor men, such were most fit to go about the 
 country to preach the gospel; but here was one that was a <I>rich 
 man,</I> ready to be employed in a piece of service which required <I>a 
 man of estate.</I> Note, Worldly wealth, though it is to many an 
 objection in religion's way, yet, in some services to be done for 
 Christ, it is an advantage and an opportunity, and it is well for those 
 who have it, if withal they have a heart to use it for God's glory. 
 
 [2.] He was well affected to our Lord Jesus, for he was himself <I>his 
 disciple,</I> believed in him, though he did not openly profess it. 
 Note, Christ has more secret disciples than we are aware of; seven 
 thousand in Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:4">Rom. xi. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The grant of the dead body procured from Pilate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>.

 Joseph <I>went to</I> Pilate, the proper person to be applied to on 
 this occasion, who had the disposal of the body; for in things wherein 
 the power of the magistrate is concerned, due regard must be had to 
 that power, and nothing done to break in upon it. What we do that is 
 good, must be done peaceably, and not tumultuously. Pilate was willing 
 to give the body to one that would inter it decently, that he might do 
 something towards atoning for the guilt his conscience charged him with 
 in condemning an innocent person. In Joseph's petition, and Pilate's 
 ready grant of it, <I>honour</I> was done to Christ, and a testimony 
 borne to his <I>integrity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The dressing of the body in its grave-clothes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>);

 though he was an honourable counsellor, yet he himself <I>took the 
 body,</I> as it should seem, into his own arms, from the infamous and 
 accursed tree 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:29">Acts xiii. 29</A>);

 for where there is true love to Christ, no service will be thought too 
 mean to stoop to for him. Having taken it, he wrapped it in a <I>clean 
 linen cloth;</I> for burying in linen was then the common usage, which 
 Joseph complied with. Note, Care is to be taken of the dead bodies of 
 good men, for there is a glory intended for them at the resurrection, 
 which we must hereby testify our belief of, and wind up the dead body 
 as designed for a better place. This common act of humanity, if done 
 after a <I>godly sort,</I> may be made an acceptable piece of 
 Christianity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The depositing of it in the sepulchre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>.

 Here there was nothing of that pomp and solemnity with which the 
 grandees of the world are <I>brought to the grave, and laid in the 
 tomb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:32">Job xxi. 32</A>.

 A private funeral did best befit him whose kingdom came not with
 observation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He was laid in a <I>borrowed</I> tomb, in Joseph's burying place; 
 as he had not a house of his own, wherein to <I>lay his head</I> while 
 he lived, so he had not a grave of his own, wherein to <I>lay his 
 body</I> when he was dead, which was an instance of his poverty; yet in 
 this there might be somewhat of a mystery. The grave is the peculiar 
 heritage of a <I>sinner,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:19">Job xxiv. 19</A>.

 There is nothing we can truly call our own but our sins and our graves;
 he <I>returneth to his earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:4">Psalm cxlvi. 4</A>.

 When we go to the grave, we go to our own place; but our Lord Jesus,
 who had no sin of his own, had no grave of his own; dying under imputed 
 sin, it was fit that he should be buried in a <I>borrowed</I> grave; 
 the Jews designed that he should have <I>made his grave with the 
 wicked,</I> should have been buried with the thieves with whom he was 
 crucified, but God over-ruled it, so as that he should make it <I>with 
 the rich in his death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:9">Isa. liii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He was laid in a <I>new tomb,</I> which Joseph, it is likely, 
 designed <I>for himself;</I> it would, however, be <I>never the 
 worse</I> for <I>his</I> lying in it, who was to rise so quickly, but a 
 <I>great deal the better</I> for <I>his</I> lying in it, who has 
 altered the property of the grave, and made it <I>anew</I> indeed, by 
 turning it into a <I>bed of rest,</I> nay into a <I>bed of spices,</I> 
 for all the saints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] In a tomb that was <I>hewn out of a rock;</I> the ground about 
 Jerusalem was generally rocky. Shebna had his sepulchre hewn out 
 thereabouts <I>in a rock,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:16">Isa. xxii. 16</A>.

 Providence ordered it that Christ's sepulchre should be in a solid
 entire rock, that no room might be left to suspect his disciples had 
 access to it by some underground passage, or broke through the back 
 wall of it, to steal the body; for there was no access to it but by the 
 door, which was watched.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] A <I>great stone was rolled to the door of his sepulchre;</I> this 
 also was according to the custom of the Jews in burying their dead, as 
 appears by the description of the grave of Lazarus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:38">John xi. 38</A>),
 
 signifying that those who are dead, are <I>separated</I> and <I>cut off 
 from all the living;</I> if the grave were his prison, now was the 
 prison-door locked and bolted. The rolling of the stone to the grave's 
 mouth, was with them as filling up the grave is with us, it completed 
 the funeral. Having thus in silence and sorrow deposited the previous 
 body of our Lord Jesus in the grave, the house <I>appointed for all 
 living,</I> they <I>departed</I> without any further ceremony. It is 
 the most melancholy circumstance in the funerals of our Christian 
 friends, when we have laid their bodies in the dark and silent grave, 
 to go home, and leave them behind; but alas, it is not we that <I>go 
 home,</I> and <I>leave them behind,</I> no, it is they that are gone to 
 the better home, and have left us behind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) The company that attended the funeral; and that was very 
 <I>small</I> and <I>mean.</I> Here were none of the relations in 
 mourning, to follow the corpse, no formalities to grace the solemnity, 
 but some good women that were true mourners--<I>Mary Magdalene, and the
 other Mary,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>.

 These, as they had attended him <I>to the cross,</I> so they followed 
 him to <I>the grave;</I> as if they composed themselves to sorrow, they 
 <I>sat over against the sepulchre,</I> not so much to fill their eyes 
 with the sight of what was done, as to empty them in rivers of tears. 
 Note, True love to Christ will carry us through, to the utmost, in 
 following him. Death itself cannot quench that divine fire, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:6,7">Cant. viii. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His enemies did what they could to prevent his resurrection; what 
 they did herein was <I>the next day that followed the day of the 
 preparation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>.

 That was the seventh day of the week, the Jewish <I>sabbath,</I> yet 
 not expressly called so, but described by this periphrasis, because it 
 was now shortly to give way to the Christian sabbath, which began the 
 day after. Now, 

 1. All that day, Christ lay dead in the grave; having for six days
 laboured and done all his work, on the seventh day he <I>rested,</I> 
 and was <I>refreshed.</I> 

 2. On that day, the <I>chief priests and Pharisees,</I> when they
 should have been at their devotions, asking pardon for the sins of the 
 week past, were dealing with Pilate about securing the sepulchre, and 
 so <I>adding rebellion to their sin.</I> They that had so often 
 quarrelled with Christ for works of the greatest mercy on that day, 
 were themselves busied in a work of the greatest malice. Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their address to <I>Pilate;</I> they were vexed that the body was 
 given to one that would bury it decently; but, since it must be so, 
 they desire a guard may be set on the sepulchre.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Their petition sets forth, that <I>that deceiver</I> (so they call 
 him who is truth itself) <I>had said, After three days I will rise 
 again.</I> He had said so, and his disciples <I>remembered</I> those 
 very words for the confirmation of their faith, but his persecutors 
 remember them for the provocation of their rage and malice. Thus the 
 same word of Christ to the one was a savour of life unto life, to the 
 other of death unto death. See how they compliment Pilate with the 
 title of <I>Sir,</I> while they reproach Christ with the title of 
 <I>Deceiver.</I> Thus the most malicious slanderers of <I>good men</I> 
 are commonly the most sordid flatterers of <I>great men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It further sets forth their jealousy; <I>lest his disciples come 
 by night, and steal him away, and say, He is risen.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> That which <I>really</I> they were afraid of, was, his
 <I>resurrection;</I> that which is most Christ's honour and his 
 people's joy, is most the terror of his enemies. That which exasperated 
 Joseph's brethren against him, was the presage of his rise, and of his 
 having dominion over them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:8">Gen. xxxvii. 8</A>);

 and all they aimed at, in what they did against him, was, to prevent 
 that. Come, say they, let us <I>slay him,</I> and see <I>what will 
 become of his dreams.</I> So the chief priests and Pharisees laboured 
 to defeat the predictions of Christ's resurrection, saying, as David's 
 enemies of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:8">Ps. xli. 8</A>),

 <I>Now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more;</I> if he should rise, 
 that would break all their measures. Note, Christ's enemies, even when 
 they have gained their point, are still in fear of losing it again.
 Perhaps the priests were surprised at the respect shown to Christ's 
 dead body by Joseph and Nicodemus, two honourable counsellors, and 
 looked upon it as an ill presage; nor can they forget his raising 
 Lazarus from <I>the dead,</I> which so confounded them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> That which they took on them to be afraid of, was, 
 lest <I>his disciples should come by night, and steal him away,</I> 
 which was a very improbable thing; for, 

 1. They had not the courage to own him while he lived, when they might
 have done him and themselves real service; and it was not likely that 
 his death should put courage into such cowards. 

 2. What could they promise themselves by stealing away his body, and
 making people believe he was risen; when, if he should not rise, and so 
 prove himself a deceiver, his disciples, who had left all for him in 
 this world, in dependence upon a recompence in the other world, would 
 of all others suffer most by the imposture, and would have had reason 
 to throw the first stone at his name? What good would it do them, to 
 carry on a cheat upon themselves, to steal away his body, and say, 
 <I>He is risen;</I> when, if he were not risen, their faith was vain, 
 and they were <I>of all men the most miserable?</I> The chief priests 
 apprehend that if the doctrine of Christ's resurrection be once 
 preached and believed, the <I>last error will be worse than the 
 first;</I> a proverbial expression, intimating no more than this, that 
 we shall all be routed, all undone. They think it was <I>their 
 error,</I> that they had so long connived at his preaching and 
 miracles, which <I>error</I> they thought they had <I>rectified</I> by 
 putting him to death; but if people should be persuaded of his 
 resurrection, that would <I>spoil all</I> again, his interest would 
 revive with him, and theirs must needs sink, who had so barbarously 
 murdered him. Note, Those that opposed Christ and his kingdom, will see 
 not only their attempts baffled, but themselves miserably 
 <I>plunged</I> and <I>embarrassed,</I> their errors each worse than 
 other, and the last worst of all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4,5">Ps. ii. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] In consideration hereof, they humbly move to have a guard set upon 
 the sepulchre till the third day; <I>Command that the sepulchre be made 
 sure.</I> Pilate must still be their drudge, his civil and military 
 power must both be engaged to serve their malice; one would think that 
 death's prisoners needed no other guard, and that the grave were 
 <I>security</I> enough to itself; but what will not those fear, who are 
 conscious to themselves both of <I>guilt</I> and <I>impotency,</I> in 
 opposing the Lord and his anointed?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Pilate's answer to this address 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>);

 <I>He have a watch, make it sure, as sure as you can.</I> He was ready 
 to gratify Christ's friends, in allowing them the body, and his 
 enemies, in setting a guard upon it, being desirous to please all 
 sides, while perhaps he laughed in his sleeve at both for making such 
 ado, <I>pro</I> and <I>con,</I> about the dead body of a man, looking 
 upon the hopes of one side and the fears of the other to be alike 
 ridiculous. <I>Ye have a watch;</I> he means the constant guard that 
 was kept in the tower of Antonia, out of which the allows them to 
 detach as many as they pleased for that purpose, but, as if ashamed to 
 be himself seen in such a thing, he leaves the management of it wholly 
 to them. Methinks that word, <I>Make it as sure as you can,</I> looks 
 like a banter, either,

 [1.] Of their <I>fears;</I> "Be sure to set a strong guard upon the 
 dead man;" or rather, 

 [2.] Of their <I>hopes;</I> "Do your worst, try your wit and strength 
 to the utmost; but if he be of God, he will rise, in spite of you and 
 all your guards." I am apt to think, that by this time Pilate had had 
 some talk with the centurion, his own officer, of whom he would be apt 
 to enquire how that <I>just man</I> died, whom he had condemned with 
 such reluctance; and that he gave him such an account of those things 
 as made him conclude that <I>truly he was the Son of God;</I> and 
 Pilate would give more credit to him than to a thousand of those 
 spiteful priests that called him a <I>Deceiver;</I> and if so, no 
 marvel that he tacitly derides their project, in thinking to secure the 
 sepulchre upon him who had so lately rent the rocks, and made the earth 
 to quake. Tertullion, speaking of Pilate, saith, <I>Ipse jam pro su&acirc; 
 conscienti&acirc; Christianus--In his conscience he was a Christian;</I> and 
 it is possible that he might be under such convictions at this time, 
 upon the centurion's report, and yet never be thoroughly persuaded, any 
 more than Agrippa or Felix was, to be a Christian.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The wonderful care they took, hereupon, to secure the sepulchre 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:66"><I>v.</I> 66</A>);

 <I>They sealed the stone;</I> probably with the great seal of their 
 <I>sanhedrim,</I> whereby they interposed their authority, for who 
 durst break the public seal? But not trusting too much to that, withal 
 they <I>set a watch,</I> to keep <I>his disciples</I> from coming to 
 <I>steal him away,</I> and, if possible, to hinder <I>him</I> from 
 coming out of the grave. So they intended, but God brought this good 
 out of it, that they who were set to <I>oppose</I> his resurrection, 
 thereby had an opportunity to observe it, and did so, and told the 
 chief priests what they observed, who were thereby rendered the more 
 inexcusable. Here was all the power of earth and hell combined to keep 
 Christ a prisoner, but all in vain, when his hour was come; death, and 
 all those sons and heirs of death, could then no longer hold him, no 
 longer have dominion over him. To guard the sepulchre against the poor 
 weak disciples, was folly, because <I>needless;</I> but to think to 
 guard it against the power of God was folly, because <I>fruitless</I> 
 and to no purpose; and yet they thought they had <I>dealt 
 wisely.</I></P>
