 The narrative of the death and sufferings of Christ is more
 particularly and fully recorded by all the four evangelists than any
 part of his history; for what should be determine, and desire to know,
 but Christ, and him crucified? And this chapter begins that memorable
 narrative. The year of the redeemed was now come, the seventy weeks
 determined were now accomplished, when transgression must be finished,
 reconciliation made, and an everlasting righteousness brought in, by
 the cutting off of Messiah the Prince,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24,26">Dan. ix. 24, 26</A>.

 That awful scene is here introduced, to be read with reverence and holy
 fear. In this chapter, we have,

 I. The preliminaries, or prefaces, to Christ's sufferings. 

 1. The previous notice given by him to his disciples,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:26-35">ver. 26-35</A>.

 II. His entrance upon them, and some of the particulars of them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these
 sayings, he said unto his disciples,
 &nbsp; 2  Ye know that after two days is <I>the feast of</I> the passover,
 and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
 &nbsp; 3  Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes,
 and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest,
 who was called Caiaphas,
 &nbsp; 4  And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and
 kill <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 5  But they said, Not on the feast <I>day,</I> lest there be an
 uproar among the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The notice Christ gave his disciples of the near approach of his
 sufferings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 While his enemies were preparing trouble for him, he was preparing 
 himself and his followers for it. He had often told them of his 
 sufferings at a distance, now he speaks of them as at the door; 
 <I>after two days,</I> Note, After many former notices of trouble we 
 still have need of fresh ones. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>time</I> when he gave this alarm; <I>when he had finished 
 all these sayings.</I> 

 [1.] Not till he had finished all he had to say. Note, Christ's
 witnesses die not till they have finished their testimony. When Christ 
 had gone through his undertaking as a prophet, he entered upon the 
 execution of his office as a priest. 

 [2.] After he had finished these sayings, which go immediately before; 
 he had bid his disciples to expect sad times, bonds and afflictions, 
 and then tells them, <I>The Son of man is betrayed;</I> to intimate 
 that they should fare no worse than he should, and that his sufferings 
 should take the sting out of theirs. Note, Thoughts of a suffering 
 Christ are great supports to a suffering Christian, suffering with him 
 and for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The thing itself he gave them notice of; <I>The Son of man is 
 betrayed.</I> The thing was not only so sure, but so near, that it was 
 as good as done. Note, It is good to make sufferings that are yet to 
 come, as present to us. He <I>is</I> betrayed, for Judas was then 
 contriving and designing to betray him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The plot of the chief priests, and scribes, and elders of the 
 people, against the life of our Lord Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:3-5">v. 3-5</A>.

 Many consultations had been held against the life of Christ but this
 plot was laid deeper than any yet, for the grandees were all engaged in 
 it. The chief priests, who presided in ecclesiastical affairs; the 
 elders, who were judges in civil matters, and the scribes, who, as 
 doctors of the law, were directors to both--these composed the 
 sanhedrim, or great council that governed the nation, and these were 
 confederate against Christ. Observe

 (1.) The <I>place</I> where they met; <I>in the palace of the high 
 priest,</I> who was the centre of their unity in this wicked project. 
 
 (2.) The plot itself; to <I>take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him;</I> 
 nothing less than his blood, his life-blood, would serve their turn. So 
 cruel and bloody have been the designs of Christ's and his church's 
 enemies. 

 (3.) The policy of the plotters; <I>Not on the feast-day.</I> Why not? 
 Was it in regard to the holiness of the time, or because they would not 
 be disturbed in the religious services of the day? No, but <I>lest 
 there should be an uproar among the people.</I> They knew Christ had a 
 great interest in the common people, of whom there was a great 
 concourse on the feast-day, and they would be in danger of taking up 
 arms against their rulers, if they should offer to lay violent hands on 
 Christ, whom all held for a prophet. They were awed, not by the fear of 
 God, but by the fear of the people; all their concern was for their own 
 safety, not God's honour. They would have it done at the feast; for it 
 was a tradition of the Jews, that malefactors should be put to death at 
 one of the three feasts, especially rebels and impostors, that <I>all 
 Israel might see and fear;</I> but <I>not on the feast-day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the
 leper,
 &nbsp; 7  There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
 precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat <I>at
 meat.</I>
 &nbsp; 8  But when his disciples saw <I>it,</I> they had indignation,
 saying, To what purpose <I>is</I> this waste?
 &nbsp; 9  For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to
 the poor.
 &nbsp; 10  When Jesus understood <I>it,</I> he said unto them, Why trouble
 ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
 &nbsp; 11  For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
 always.
 &nbsp; 12  For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she
 did <I>it</I> for my burial.
 &nbsp; 13  Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
 preached in the whole world, <I>there</I> shall also this, that this
 woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage of story, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The singular kindness of a good woman to our Lord Jesus in anointing 
 his head, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 It was <I>in Bethany,</I> a village hard by Jerusalem, and <I>in the 
 house of Simon the leper.</I> Probably, he was one who had been 
 miraculously cleansed from his leprosy by our Lord Jesus, and he would 
 express his gratitude to Christ by entertaining him; nor did Christ 
 disdain to converse with him, to come in to him, and sup with him. 
 Though he was cleansed, yet he was called <I>Simon the leper.</I> Those 
 who are guilty of scandalous sins, will find that, though the sin be 
 pardoned, the reproach will cleave to them, and will hardly be wiped 
 away. The woman that did this, is supposed to have been Mary, the 
 sister of Martha and Lazarus. And Dr. Lightfoot thinks it was the same 
 that was called <I>Mary Magdalene.</I> She had a <I>box of ointment 
 very precious,</I> which she <I>poured upon the head</I> of Christ as 
 he sat at meat. This, among us, would be a strange sort of compliment. 
 But it was then accounted the highest piece of respect; for the smell 
 was very grateful, and the ointment itself refreshing to the head. 
 David had his <I>head anointed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:5,Lu+7:46">Ps. xxiii. 5; Luke vii. 46</A>.

 Now this may be looked upon,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As an act of faith in our Lord Jesus, the Christ, the Messiah, the 
 anointed. To signify that she believed in him as God's anointed, whom 
 he had set king, she anointed him, and made him her king. They shall 
 <I>appoint themselves one head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:11">Hos. i. 11</A>.

 This is <I>kissing the Son.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As an act of love and respect to him. Some think that this was he 
 who <I>loved much</I> at first, and <I>washed Christ's feet with her 
 tears</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:38,47">Luke vii. 38, 47</A>);

 and that she had not left her first love, but was now as affectionate 
 in the devotions of a grown Christian as she was in those of a young 
 beginner. Note, Where there is true love in the heart to Jesus Christ, 
 nothing will be thought too good, no, nor good enough, to bestow upon 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The offence which the disciples took at this. They <I>had 
 indignation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>),

 were vexed to see this ointment thus spent, which they thought might 
 have been better bestowed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See how they expressed their offence at it. They said, <I>To what 
 purpose is this waste?</I> Now this bespeaks,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Want of tenderness toward this good woman, in interpreting her 
 over-kindness (suppose it was so) to be wastefulness. Charity teaches 
 us to put the best construction upon every thing that it will bear, 
 especially upon the words and actions of those that are <I>zealously 
 affected in doing a good thing,</I> though we may think them not 
 altogether so discreet in it as they might be. It is true, there may be 
 over-doing in well-doing; but thence we must learn to be cautious 
 ourselves, lest we run into extremes, but not to be censorious of 
 others; because that which we may impute to the want of prudence, God 
 may accept as an instance of abundant love. We must not say, Those do 
 too much in religion, that do more than we do, but rather aim to do as 
 much as they.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Want of respect to their Master. The best we can make of it, is, 
 that they knew their Master was perfectly dead to all the delights of 
 sense; he that was so much <I>grieved for the affliction of Joseph,</I> 
 cared not for being <I>anointed with the chief ointments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:6">Amos vi. 6</A>.
 
 And therefore they thought such pleasures ill bestowed upon one who
 took so little pleasure in them. But supposing that, it did not become 
 them to call it <I>waste,</I> when they perceived that he admitted and 
 accepted it as a token of his friend's love. Note, We must take heed of 
 thinking any thing waste, which is bestowed upon the Lord Jesus, either 
 by others or by ourselves. We must not think that time waste, that is 
 spent in the service of Christ, or that money waste, which is laid out 
 in any work of piety; for, though it seem to be cast upon the waters, 
 to be thrown down the river, we shall <I>find it again,</I> to 
 advantage, <I>after many days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:1">Eccl. xi. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See how they excused their offence at it, and what pretence they 
 made for it; <I>This ointment might have been sold for much, and given 
 to the poor.</I> Note, It is no new thing for bad affections to shelter 
 themselves under specious covers; for people to shift off works of 
 piety under colour of works of charity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reproof Christ gave to his disciples for the offence at this 
 good woman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>);

 <I>Why trouble ye the woman?</I> Note, It is a great trouble to good 
 people to have their good works censured and misconstrued; and it is a 
 thing that Jesus Christ takes very ill. He here took part with a good, 
 honest, zealous, well-meaning woman, against all his disciples, though 
 they seemed to have so much reason on their side; so heartily does he 
 espouse the cause of the <I>offended little ones,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:10"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe his reason; <I>You have the poor always with you.</I> Note,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There are some opportunities of doing and getting good which are 
 constant, and which we must give constant attendance to the improvement 
 of. Bibles we have always with us, sabbaths always with us, and so 
 <I>the poor, we have always with us.</I> Note, Those who have a heart 
 to do good, never need complain for want of opportunity. The poor never 
 ceased even out of the land of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:11">Deut. xv. 11</A>.

 We cannot but see some in this world, who call for our charitable
 assistance, who are as God's receivers, some poor members of Christ, to 
 whom he will have kindness shown as to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There are other opportunities of doing and getting good, which come 
 but seldom, which are short and uncertain, and require more peculiar 
 diligence in the improvement of them, and which ought to be preferred 
 before the other; "<I>Me ye have not always,</I> therefore use me while 
 ye have me." Note, 

 (1.) Christ's constant <I>bodily</I> presence was not to be expected 
 here in this world; it was expedient that he should go away; his 
 <I>real</I> presence in the eucharist is a fond and groundless conceit, 
 and contradicts what he here said, <I>Me ye have not always.</I> 

 (2.) Sometimes special works of piety and devotion should take place of 
 common works of charity. The poor must not rob Christ; we must do good 
 to all, but <I>especially to the household of faith.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ's approbation and commendation of the kindness of this good 
 woman. The more his servants and their services are cavilled at by men, 
 the more he manifests his acceptance of them. He calls it a <I>good 
 work</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and says more in praise of it than could have been imagined; 
 particularly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the meaning of it was mystical 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 <I>She did it for my burial.</I> 

 (1.) Some think that she <I>intended</I> it so, and that the woman 
 better understood Christ's frequent predictions of his death and 
 sufferings than the apostles did; for which they were recompensed with 
 the honour of being the first witnesses of his resurrection. 

 (2.) However, Christ interpreted it so; and he is always willing to 
 make the best, to make the most of his people's well-meant words and 
 actions. This was as it were the embalming of his body; because the
 doing of that after his death would be prevented by his resurrection, 
 it was therefore done before; for it was fit that it should be done 
 some time, to show that he was still the Messiah, even when he seemed 
 to be triumphed over by death. The disciples thought the ointment 
 wasted, which was poured upon his head. "But," saith he, "If so much
 ointment were poured upon a dead body, according to the custom of your 
 country, you would not grudge it, or think it waste. Now this is, in
 effect, so; the body she anoints is as good as dead, and her kindness 
 is very seasonable for that purpose; therefore rather than call it 
 waste, put it upon that score."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That the memorial of it should be honourable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 <I>This shall be told for a memorial.</I> This act of faith and love 
 was so remarkable, that the preachers of Christ crucified, and the 
 inspired writers of the history of his passion, could not choose but 
 take notice of this passage, proclaim the notice of it, and perpetuate 
 the memorial of it. And being once enrolled in these records, it was 
 <I>graven as with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever,</I> and 
 could not possibly be forgotten. None of all the trumpets of fame
 sound so loud and so long as the everlasting gospel. Note, 

 (1.) The story of the death of Christ, though a tragical one, is 
 gospel, glad-tidings, because he died for us. 

 (2.) The gospel was to be preached in the whole world; not in Judea 
 only, but in every nation, to every creature. Let the disciples take 
 notice of this, for their encouragement, that their sound should go to 
 the ends of the earth.

 (3.) Though the honour of Christ is principally designed in the gospel, 
 yet the honour of his saints and servants is not altogether overlooked.
 The memorial of this woman was to be preserved, not by dedicating a 
 church to her, or keeping an annual feast in honour of her, or 
 preserving a piece of her broken box for a sacred relic; but by 
 mentioning her faith and piety in the preaching of the gospel, for 
 example to others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:12">Heb. vi. 12</A>.

 Hereby honour redounds to Christ himself, who in this world, as well as
 in that to come, will be <I>glorified in his saints, and admired in all 
 them that believe.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
 chief priests,
 &nbsp; 15  And said <I>unto them,</I> What will ye give me, and I will
 deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty
 pieces of silver.
 &nbsp; 16  And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Immediately after an instance of the greatness kindness done to Christ, 
 follows an instance of the greatest unkindness; such mixture is there 
 of good and bad among the followers of Christ; he hath some faithful 
 friends, and some false and feigned ones. What could be more base than
 this agreement which Judas here made with the chief priests, to betray 
 Christ to them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The traitor was Judas Iscariot; he is said to be <I>one of the 
 twelve,</I> as an aggravation of his villany. When the <I>number of the 
 disciples was multiplied</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:1">Acts vi. 1</A>),

 no marvel if there were some among them that were a shame and trouble 
 to them; but when there were but twelve, and one of them was <I>a 
 devil,</I> surely we must never expect any society perfectly pure on 
 this side heaven. The twelve were Christ's chosen friends, that had the 
 privilege of his special favour; they were his constant followers, that 
 had the benefit of his most intimate converse, that upon all accounts 
 had reason to love him and be true to him; and yet one of them betrayed 
 him. Note, No bonds of duty or gratitude will hold those that have a 
 devil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:3,4">Mark v. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the proffer which he made to the chief priests; he <I>went 
 to them, and said, What will ye give me?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They did not send for him, nor make the proposal to him; they could not 
 have thought that one of Christ's own disciples should be false to him. 
 Note, There are those, even among Christ's followers, that are worse 
 than any one can imagine them to be, and want nothing but opportunity 
 to show it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. What Judas promised; "<I>I will deliver him unto you;</I> I will let
 you know where he is, and undertake to bring you to him, at such a 
 convenient time and place that you may seize him without noise, or 
 danger of an uproar." In their conspiracy against Christ, this was it 
 they were at a loss about,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 They durst not meddle with him in public, and knew not where to find 
 him in private. Here the matter rested, and the difficulty was 
 insuperable; till Judas came, and offered them his service. Note, Those 
 that give up themselves to be led by the devil, find him readier than 
 they imagine to help them at a dead lift, as Judas did the chief 
 priests. Though the rulers, by their power and interest, could kill him 
 when they had him in their hands, yet none but a disciple could betray 
 him. Note, The greater profession men make of religion, and the more 
 they are employed in the study and service of it, the greater 
 opportunity they have of doing mischief, if their hearts be not right 
 with God. If Judas had not been an apostle, he could not have been a
 traitor; if men had known the way of righteousness, they could not have 
 abused it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>I will deliver him unto you.</I> He did not offer himself, nor did 
 they tamper with him, to be a witness against Christ, though they 
 wanted evidence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>.

 And if there had been any thing to be alleged against him, which had 
 but the colour of proof that he was an impostor, Judas was the 
 likeliest person to have attested it; but this is an evidence of the 
 innocency of our Lord Jesus, that his own disciple, who knew so well 
 his doctrine and manner of life, and was false to him, could not charge 
 him with any thing criminal, though it would have served to justify his 
 treachery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he asked in consideration of this undertaking; <I>What will ye 
 give me?</I> This was the only thing that made Judas betray his Master; 
 he hoped to get money by it: his Master had not given him any 
 provocation, though he knew from the first that he <I>had a devil;</I> 
 yet, for aught that appears, he showed the same kindness to him that he 
 did to the rest, and put no mark of disgrace upon him that might 
 disoblige him; he had placed him in a post that pleased him, had made 
 him purse-bearer, and though he had embezzled the common stock (for he 
 is called <I>a thief,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:6">John xii. 6</A>),

 yet we do not find he was in any danger of being called to account for 
 it; nor does it appear that he had any suspicion that the gospel was a 
 cheat: no, it was not the hatred of his Master, nor any quarrel with 
 him, but purely the love of money; that, and nothing else, made Judas a 
 traitor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>What will ye give me?</I> Why, what did he want? Neither bread to 
 eat, nor raiment to put on; neither necessaries nor conveniences. Was 
 not he welcome, wherever his Master was? Did he not fare as he fared? 
 Had he not been but just now nobly entertained at a supper in Bethany, 
 in the house of Simon the leper, and a little before at another, where 
 no less a person than Martha herself waited at table? And yet this 
 covetous wretch could not be content, but comes basely cringing to the 
 priests with, <I>What will ye give me?</I> Note, It is not the 
 <I>lack</I> of money, but the <I>love</I> of money, that is the root of 
 all evil, and particularly of apostasy from Christ; witness Demas, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:10">2 Tim. iv. 10</A>.

 Satan tempted our Saviour with this bait, <I>All these things will I
 give thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:9"><I>ch.</I> iv. 9</A>);

 but Judas offered himself to be tempted with it; he asks, <I>What will
 ye give me?</I> as if his Master was a commodity that stuck on his 
 hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the bargain which the chief priests made with him; <I>they 
 covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver;</I> thirty shekels, 
 which in our money is about three pounds eight shillings, so some; 
 three pounds fifteen shillings, so others. It should seem, Judas
 referred himself to them, and was willing to take what they were 
 willing to give; he catches at the first offer, lest the next should be 
 worse. Judas had not been wont to trade high, and therefore a little 
 money went a great way with him. By the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:32">Exod. xxi. 32</A>),

 thirty pieces of silver was the price of a slave--a goodly price, at
 which Christ was valued! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:13">Zech. xi. 13</A>.

 No wonder that Zion's sons, though comparable to fine gold, are 
 esteemed as earthen pitchers, when Zion's King himself was thus 
 undervalued. They <I>covenanted with him;</I> 
 <B><I>estesan</I></B>--<I>appenderunt--they paid it down,</I> so some; 
 gave him his wages in hand, to secure him and to encourage him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is the industry of Judas, in pursuance of his bargain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);
 
 <I>he sought opportunity to betray him,</I> his head was still working 
 to find out how he might do it effectually. Note, 

 1. It is a very wicked thing to seek opportunity to sin, and to devise
 mischief; for it argues the heart fully set in men to do evil, and a 
 malice prepense. 

 2. Those that are <I>in,</I> think they must <I>on,</I> though the
 matter be ever so bad. After he had made that wicked bargain, he had 
 time to repent, and to revoke it; but now by his covenant the devil has 
 one hank more upon him than he had, and tells him that he must be true 
 to his word, though ever so false to his Master, as Herod must behead 
 John <I>for his oath's sake.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Now the first <I>day</I> of the <I>feast of</I> unleavened bread the
 disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we
 prepare for thee to eat the passover?
 &nbsp; 18  And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto
 him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the
 passover at thy house with my disciples.
 &nbsp; 19  And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they
 made ready the passover.
 &nbsp; 20  Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
 &nbsp; 21  And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that
 one of you shall betray me.
 &nbsp; 22  And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of
 them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
 &nbsp; 23  And he answered and said, He that dippeth <I>his</I> hand with me
 in the dish, the same shall betray me.
 &nbsp; 24  The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto
 that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for
 that man if he had not been born.
 &nbsp; 25  Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master,
 is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Christ's keeping the passover. Being made 
 under the law, he submitted to all the ordinances of it, and to this 
 among the rest; it was kept in remembrance of Israel's deliverance out 
 of Egypt, the birth-day of that people; it was a tradition of the Jews, 
 that in the days of the Messiah they should be redeemed on the very day 
 of their coming out of Egypt; and it was exactly fulfilled, for Christ 
 died the day after the passover, in which day they began their 
 march.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when Christ ate the passover, was the usual time appointed 
 by God, and observed by the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 <I>the first day of the feast of unleavened bread,</I> which that year 
 happened on the fifth day of the week, which is our Thursday. Some have 
 advanced a suggestion, that our Lord Jesus celebrated the passover at 
 this time of day sooner than other people did; but the learned Dr. 
 Whitby has largely disproved it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The place where, was particularly appointed by himself to the 
 disciples, upon their enquiry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 they asked, <I>Where wilt thou that we prepare the passover?</I> 
 Perhaps Judas was one of those that asked this question (where he would 
 eat the passover,) that he might know the better how to lay his train; 
 but the rest of the disciples asked it as usual, that they might do 
 their duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They took it for granted that their Master would eat the passover, 
 though he was at this time persecuted by the chief priests, and his 
 life sought; they knew that he would not be put by his duty, either by 
 frightenings without or fears within. Those do not follow Christ's
 example who make it an excuse for their not attending on the Lord's 
 supper, our gospel passover, that they have many troubles and many 
 enemies, are full of care and fear; for, if so, they have the more need 
 of that ordinance, to help to silence their fears, and comfort them 
 under their troubles, to help them in forgiving their enemies, and 
 casting all their cares on God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They knew very well that there must be preparation made for it, and 
 that it was their business, as his servants, to make preparation; 
 <I>Where wilt thou that we prepare?</I> Note, Before solemn ordinances 
 there must be solemn preparation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They knew that he had no house of his own wherein to eat the 
 passover; in this, as in other things, <I>for our sakes he became 
 poor.</I> Among all Zion's palaces there was none for Zion's King; but 
 his kingdom was not of this world. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:11">John i. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They would not pitch upon a place without direction from him, and 
 from him they had direction; he sent them to <I>such a man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 who probably was a friend and follower of his, and to his house he 
 invited himself and his disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Tell him, <I>My time is at hand;</I> he means the time of his 
 death, elsewhere called <I>his hour</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:20,13:1">John viii. 20; xiii. 1</A>);

 the time, the hour, fixed in the counsel of God, which his heart was 
 upon, and which he had so often spoken of. He knew when it was at hand, 
 and was busy accordingly; we <I>know not our time</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:12">Eccl. ix. 12</A>),

 and therefore must never be off our watch; <I>our time is always 
 ready</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:6">John vii. 6</A>),

 and therefore we must be always ready. Observe, Because his <I>time was 
 at hand,</I> he would <I>keep the passover</I> Note, The consideration 
 of the near approach of death should quicken us to a diligent 
 improvement of all our opportunities for our souls. Is our time at 
 hand, and an eternity just before us? <I>Let us then keep the feast 
 with the unleavened bread of sincerity.</I> Observe, When our Lord 
 Jesus invited himself to this good man's house, he sent him this 
 intelligence, that his time was at hand. Note, Christ's secret is with 
 them that entertain him in their hearts. Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:21,Re+3:20">John xiv. 21 with Rev. iii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Tell him, <I>I will keep the passover at thy house.</I> This was 
 an instance of his authority, as <I>the Master,</I> which it is likely 
 this man acknowledged; he did not beg, but command, the use of his 
 house for this purpose. Thus, when Christ by his Spirit comes into the 
 heart, he demands admission, as one whose own the heart is and cannot 
 be denied, and he gains admission as one who has all power in the heart 
 and cannot be resisted; if he saith, "I will keep a feast in such a 
 soul," he will do it; for he works, and none can hinder; his people 
 shall be willing, for he makes them so. <I>I will keep the passover 
 with my disciples.</I> Note, Wherever Christ is welcome, he expects 
 that his disciples should be welcome too. When we take God for our God, 
 we take his people for our people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The preparation was made by the disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>They did as Jesus had appointed.</I> Note, Those who would have 
 Christ's presence with them in the gospel passover, must strictly 
 observe his instructions, and do as he directs; <I>They made ready the 
 passover;</I> they got the lamb killed in the court of the temple, got 
 it roasted, the bitter herbs provided, bread and wine, the cloth laid, 
 and every thing set in readiness for such a sacred solemn feast.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They ate the passover according to the law
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 <I>He sat down,</I> in the usual table-gesture, not lying on one side, 
 for it was not easy to eat, nor possible to drink, in that posture, but 
 sitting upright, though perhaps sitting low. It is the same word that 
 is used for his posture at other meals,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:10,Lu+7:37,Mt+26:7"><I>ch.</I> ix. 10;
 Luke vii. 37; <I>ch.</I> xxvi. 7</A>.

 It was only the first passover in Egypt, as most think, that was eaten
 with <I>their loins girded, shoes on their feet, and staff in their 
 hand,</I> though all that might be in a sitting posture. His sitting 
 down, denotes the composedness of his mind, when he addressed himself 
 to this solemnity; <I>He sat down with the twelve,</I> Judas not 
 excepted. By the law, they were to <I>take a lamb for a household</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:3,4">Exod. xii. 3, 4</A>),

 which were to be not less than ten, nor more than twenty; Christ's 
 disciples were his household. Note, They whom God has charged with 
 families, must have their houses with them in serving the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We have here Christ's discourse with his disciples at the 
 passover-supper. The usual subject of discourse at that ordinance, was 
 the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:26,27">Exod. xii. 26, 27</A>);

 but the great Passover is now ready to be offered, and the discourse of 
 that swallows up all talk of the other, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:14,15">Jer. xvi. 14, 15</A>).
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The general notice Christ gives his disciples of the treachery that 
 should be among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 <I>One of you shall betray me.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) Christ knew it. We know not what troubles will befal us, nor 
 whence they will arise: but Christ knew all his, which, as it proves 
 his omniscience, so it magnifies his love, that he knew all things that 
 should befal him, and yet did not draw back. He foresaw the treachery 
 and baseness of a disciple of his own, and yet went on; took care of 
 those that were given him, though he knew there was a Judas among them; 
 would pay the price of our redemption, though he foresaw some would 
 <I>deny the Lord that bought them;</I> and shed his blood, though he 
 knew it would be <I>trodden under foot as an unholy thing.</I> 

 (2.) When there was occasion, he let those about him know it. He had 
 often told them that the Son of man should be betrayed; now he tells 
 them that one of them should do it, that when they saw it, they might 
 not only be the less surprised, but have their faith in him confirmed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:19,14:29">John xiii. 19; xiv. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The disciples' feelings on this occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 How did they take it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>They were exceeding sorrowful.</I> 

 [1.] It troubled them much to hear that their Master should be 
 betrayed. When Peter was first told of it, he said, <I>Be it far from 
 thee;</I> and therefore it must needs be a great trouble to him and the 
 rest of them, to hear that it was very <I>near</I> to him. 

 [2.] It troubled them more to hear that one of them should do it. It
 would be a reproach to the fraternity, for an apostle to prove a 
 traitor, and this grieved them; gracious souls grieve for the sins of 
 others, especially of those that have made a more than ordinary 
 profession of religion. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:29">2 Cor. xi. 29</A>.

 [3.] It troubled them most of all, that they were left at uncertainty 
 which of them it was, and each of them was afraid for himself, lest, as 
 Hazael speaks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:13">2 Kings viii. 13</A>),

 he was the <I>dog</I> that should <I>do this great thing.</I> Those 
 that know the strength and subtlety of the tempter, and their own 
 weakness and folly, cannot but be in pain for themselves, when they 
 hear that <I>the love of many will wax cold.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>They began every one of them to say, Lord, is it I?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They were not apt to suspect Judas. Though he was <I>a thief,</I> 
 yet, it seems, he had carried it so plausibly, that those who were 
 intimate with him, were not jealous of him: none of them so much as 
 looked upon him, much less said, <I>Lord, is it Judas?</I> Note, It is 
 possible for a hypocrite to go through the world, not only 
 undiscovered, but unsuspected; like bad money so ingeniously 
 counterfeited that nobody questions it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They were apt to suspect themselves; <I>Lord, is it I?</I> Though 
 they were not conscious to themselves of any inclination that way (no 
 such thought had ever entered into their mind), yet they feared the 
 worst, and asked Him who knows us better than we know ourselves, 
 <I>Lord, is it I?</I> Note, It well becomes the disciples of Christ 
 always to be jealous over themselves with a godly jealousy, especially 
 in trying times. We know not how strongly we may be tempted, nor how 
 far God may leave us to ourselves, and therefore have reason, <I>not to 
 be high-minded, but fear.</I> It is observable that our Lord Jesus, 
 just before he instituted the Lord's supper, put his disciples upon 
 this trial and suspicion of themselves, to teach us to examine and 
 <I>judge ourselves, and so to eat of that bread, and drink of that 
 cup.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Further information given them concerning this matter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>),
 
 where Christ tells them, 

 (1.) That the traitor was a familiar friend; <I>He that dippeth his 
 hand with me in the dish,</I> that is, One of you that are now with me 
 at the table. He mentions this, to make the treachery appear the more 
 exceeding sinful. Note, External communion with Christ in holy 
 ordinances is a great aggravation of our falseness to him. It is base 
 ingratitude to dip with Christ in the dish, and yet betray him. 

 (2.) That this was according to the scripture, which would take off the 
 offence at it. Was Christ betrayed by a disciple? So it was written 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+61:9">Ps. lxi. 9</A>);

 <I>He that did eat bread with me, hath lifted up his heel against 
 me.</I> The more we see of the fulfilling of the scripture in our 
 troubles, the better we may bear them. 

 (3.) That it would prove a very dear bargain to the traitor; <I>Woe to 
 that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed.</I> This he said, not only 
 to awaken the conscience of Judas, and bring him to repent, and revoke 
 his bargain, but for warning to all others to take heed of sinning like 
 Judas; though God can serve his own purposes by the sins of men, that 
 doth not make the sinner's condition the less woeful; <I>It had been 
 good for that man, if he had not been born.</I> Note, The ruin that 
 attends those who betray Christ, is so great, that it were more 
 eligible by far not be at all than to be thus miserable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The conviction of Judas, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 (1.) He asked, <I>Is it I?</I> to avoid coming under the suspicion of 
 guilt by his silence. He knew very well that it was he, and yet wished 
 to appear a stranger to such a plot. Note, Many whose consciences 
 condemn them are very industrious to justify themselves before men, and 
 put a good face on it, with, <I>Lord, is it I?</I> He could not but 
 know that Christ knew, and yet trusted so much to his courtesy, because 
 he had hitherto concealed it, that he had the impudence to challenge 
 him to tell: or, perhaps, he was so much under the power of infidelity, 
 that he imagined Christ did not know it, as those who said, <I>The Lord 
 shall not see</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:7">Ps. xciv. 7</A>),

 and asked, <I>Can he judge through the dark clouds?</I> 

 (2.) Christ soon answered this question; <I>Thou hast said,</I> that 
 is, It is as thou hast said. This is not spoken out so plainly as 
 Nathan's <I>Thou art the man;</I> but it was enough to convict him, 
 and, if his heart had not been wretchedly hardened, to have broken the 
 neck of his plot, when he saw it discovered to his Master, and 
 discovered by him. Note, They who are contriving to betray Christ, 
 will, some time or other, betray themselves, and <I>their own tongues 
 will fall upon them.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the institution of the great gospel ordinance of the 
 Lord's supper, which was received of the Lord. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when it was instituted--<I>as they were eating.</I> At the
 latter end of the passover-supper, before the table was drawn, because, 
 as a feast upon a sacrifice, it was to come in the room of that 
 ordinance. Christ is to us the Passover-sacrifice by which atonement is 
 made 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:7">1 Cor. v. 7</A>);

 <I>Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.</I> This ordinance is to 
 us the passover-supper, by which application is made, and commemoration 
 celebrated, of a much greater deliverance than that of Israel out of 
 Egypt. All the legal sacrifices of propitiation being summed up in the 
 death of Christ, and so abolished, all the legal feasts of rejoicing 
 were summed up in this sacrament, and so abolished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The institution itself. A sacrament must be instituted; it is no 
 part of moral worship, nor is it dictated by natural light, but has 
 both its being and significancy from the institution, from a divine 
 institution; it is his prerogative who established the covenant, to 
 appoint the seals of it. Hence the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:23">1 Cor. xi. 23</A>,

 &c.), in that discourse of his concerning this ordinance, all along
 calls Jesus Christ <I>the Lord,</I> because, as <I>Lord,</I> as Lord of 
 the covenant, Lord of the church, he appointed this ordinance. In 
 which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The body of Christ is signified and represented by bread; he had 
 said formerly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:35">John vi. 35</A>),

 <I>I am the bread of life,</I> upon which metaphor this sacrament is 
 built; as the life of the body is supported by bread, which is 
 therefore put for all bodily nourishment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:4,6:11"><I>ch.</I> iv. 4; vi. 11</A>),

 so the life of the soul is supported and maintained by Christ's
 mediation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>He took bread,</I> <B><I>ton apton</I></B>--<I>the loaf;</I>
 some loaf that lay ready to hand, fit for the purpose; it was, 
 probably, unleavened bread; but, that circumstance not being taken 
 notice of, we are not to bind ourselves to that, as some of the Greek 
 churches do. His taking the bread was a solemn action, and was, 
 probably, done in such a manner as to be observed by them that sat with 
 him, that they might expect something more than ordinary to be done 
 with it. Thus was the Lord Jesus set apart in the counsels of divine
 love for the working out of our redemption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>He blessed it;</I> set it apart for this use by prayer and 
 thanksgiving. We do not find any set form of words used by him upon 
 this occasion; but what he said, no doubt, was accommodated to the 
 business in hand, that new testament which by this ordinance was to be 
 sealed and ratified. This was like God's <I>blessing the seventh 
 day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:3">Gen. ii. 3</A>),

 by which it was separated to God's honour, and made to all that duly 
 observe it, a blessed day: Christ could command the blessing, and we, 
 in his name, are emboldened to beg the blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) <I>He brake it;</I> which denotes, 

 [1.] The breaking of Christ's body for us, that it might be fitted for 
 our use; <I>He was bruised for our iniquities,</I> as <I>bread-corn is 
 bruised</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:28">Isa. xxviii. 28</A>);

 though <I>a bone of him was not broken</I> (for all his breaking did
 not weaken him), yet his flesh was <I>broken with breach upon 
 breach,</I> and his wounds were multiplied 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:17,16:14">Job ix. 17; xvi. 14</A>),

 and that pained him. God complains that he is broken with the 
 <I>whorish heart</I> of sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9">Ezek. vi. 9</A>);

 his law broken, our covenants with him broken; now justice requires 
 <I>breach for breach</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:20">Lev. xxiv. 20</A>),

 and Christ was broken, to satisfy that demand.

 [2.] The breaking of Christ's body to us, as the father of the family 
 breaks the bread to the children. The breaking of Christ to us, is to 
 facilitate the application; every thing is made ready for us by the 
 grants of God's word and the operations of his grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) <I>He gave it to his disciples,</I> as the Master of the family, 
 and the Master of this feast; it is not said, He gave it <I>to the 
 apostles,</I> though they were so, and had been often called so before 
 this, but <I>to the disciples,</I> because all the disciples of Christ 
 have a right to this ordinance; and those shall have the benefit of it 
 who are his disciples indeed; yet he gave it to them as he did the 
 multiplied loaves, by them to be handed to all his other followers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) <I>He said, Take, eat; this is my body,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 He here tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What they should do with it; "<I>Take, eat;</I> accept of Christ 
 as he is offered to you, receive the atonement, approve of it, consent 
 to it, come up to the terms on which the benefit of it is proposed to 
 you; submit to his grace and to his government." Believing on Christ is 
 expressed by <I>receiving him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:12">John i. 12</A>),

 and <I>feeding upon him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:57,58">John vi. 57, 58</A>.

 Meat looked upon, or the dish ever so well garnished, will not nourish 
 us; it must be fed upon: so must the doctrine of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What they should have with it; <I>This is my body,</I> not 
 <B><I>outos</I></B>--<I>this bread,</I> but <B><I>touto</I></B>--<I>this
 eating and drinking.</I> Believing carries all the efficacy of Christ's 
 death to our souls. <I>This is my body,</I> spiritually and 
 sacramentally; this signifies and represents my body. He employs 
 sacramental language, like that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:11">Exod. xii. 11</A>.

 <I>It is the Lord's passover.</I> Upon a carnal and much--mistaken
 sense of these words, the church of Rome builds the monstrous doctrine 
 of Transubstantiation, which makes the bread to be changed into the 
 substance of Christ's body, only the accidents of bread remaining; 
 which affronts Christ, destroys the nature of a sacrament, and gives 
 the lie to our senses. We partake of the sun, not by having the bulk 
 and body of the sun put into our hands, but the beams of it darted down 
 upon us; so we partake of Christ by partaking of his grace, and the 
 blessed fruits of the breaking of his body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The blood of Christ is signified and represented by the wine; to 
 make it a complete feast, here is not only bread to strengthen, but 
 wine to <I>make glad the heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>);

 <I>He took the cup,</I> the grace-cup, which was set ready to be drank, 
 after thanks returned, according to the custom of the Jews at the 
 passover; this Christ took, and made the sacramental-cup, and so 
 altered the property. It was intended for a <I>cup of blessing</I> (so 
 the Jews called it), and therefore St. Paul studiously distinguished 
 between the cup of blessing which <I>we</I> bless, and that which 
 <I>they</I> bless. <I>He gave thanks,</I> to teach us, not only in 
 every ordinance, but in every part of the ordinance, to have our eyes 
 up to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This cup he gave to the disciples,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) With a command; <I>Drink ye all of it.</I> Thus he welcomes his 
 guests to his table, obliges them all to drink of his cup. Why should 
 he so expressly command them all to drink, and to see that none let it 
 pass them, and press that more expressly in this than in the other part 
 of the ordinance? Surely it was because he foresaw how in after-ages 
 this ordinance would be dismembered by the prohibition of the cup to 
 the laity, with an express <I>non obstante--notwithstanding</I> to the
 command.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) With an explication; <I>For this is my blood of the New 
 Testament.</I> Therefore drink it with appetite, delight, because it is 
 so rich a cordial. Hitherto the blood of Christ had been represented by 
 the blood of beasts, real blood: but, after it was actually shed, it 
 was represented by the blood of grapes, metaphorical blood; so wine is 
 called in an Old-Testament prophecy of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10,11">Gen. xlix. 10, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now observe what Christ saith of his blood represented in the 
 sacrament.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>It is my blood of the New Testament.</I> The Old Testament was 
 confirmed by the <I>blood of bulls and goats</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:19,20,Ex+24:8">Heb. ix. 19, 20; Exod. xxiv. 8</A>);

 but the New Testament with the blood of Christ, which is here 
 distinguished from that; <I>It is my blood of the New Testament.</I> 
 The covenant God is pleased to make with us, and all the benefits and 
 privileges of it, are owing to the merits of Christ's death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>It is shed;</I> it was not shed till next day, but it was now 
 upon the point of being shed, it is as good as done. "Before you come 
 to repeat this ordinance yourselves, it will be shed." He was <I>now 
 ready to be offered,</I> and his blood to be poured out, as the blood 
 of the sacrifices which made atonement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] <I>It is shed for many.</I> Christ came to confirm <I>a covenant 
 with many</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Dan. ix. 27</A>),

 and the intent of his death agreed. The blood of the Old Testament was 
 shed for a few: it confirmed a covenant, which (saith Moses) the Lord 
 has <I>made with you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:8">Exod. xxiv. 8</A>.

 The atonement was made only <I>for the children of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:34">Lev. xvi. 34</A>):

 but Jesus Christ is a propitiation <I>for the sins of the whole 
 world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:2">1 John ii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] It <I>is shed for the remission of sins,</I> that is, to purchase 
 remission of sins for us. The redemption which we have through his 
 blood, is <I>the remission of sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:7">Eph. i. 7</A>.

 The new covenant which is procured and ratified by the blood of Christ,
 is a charter of pardon, an act of indemnity, in order to a 
 reconciliation between God and man; for sin was the only thing that 
 made the quarrel, and <I>without shedding of blood is no remission,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:22">Heb. ix. 22</A>.

 The pardon of sin is that great blessing which is, in the Lord's
 supper, conferred upon all true believers; it is the foundation of all 
 other blessings, and the spring of everlasting comfort,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:2,3"><I>ch.</I> ix. 2, 3</A>.

 A farewell is now bidden to the fruit of the vine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Christ and his disciples had now feasted together with a deal of
 comfort, in both an Old Testament and a New Testament festival,
 <I>fibula utriusque Testamenti--the connecting tie of both
 Testaments.</I> How amiable were these tabernacles! How good to be
 here! Never such a heaven upon earth as was at this table; but it was
 not intended for a perpetuity; he now told them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:16">John xvi. 16</A>),

 that <I>yet a little while and they should not see him: and again a
 little while and they should see him,</I> which explains this here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He takes leave of such communion; <I>I will not drink 
 henceforth of this fruit of the vine,</I> that is, now that I am no 
 more in the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11">John xvii. 11</A>);

 I have had enough of it, and am glad to think of leaving it, glad to 
 think that this is the last meal. <I>Farewell this fruit of the
 vine,</I> this passover-cup, this sacramental wine. Dying saints take 
 their leave of sacraments, and the other ordinances of communion which 
 they enjoy in this world, with comfort, for the joy and glory they 
 enter into supersede them all; when the sun rises, farewell the 
 candles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He assures them of a happy meeting again at last. It 
 is a long, but not an everlasting, farewell; <I>until that day when I 
 drink it new with you.</I> 

 1. Some understand it of the interviews he had with them after his
 resurrection, which was the first step of his exaltation <I>into the 
 kingdom of his Father;</I> and though during those forty days he did 
 not converse with them so constantly as he had done, yet he <I>did eat 
 and drink with them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:41">Acts x. 41</A>),

 which, as it confirmed their faith, so doubtless it greatly comforted 
 their hearts, for they were overjoyed at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:41">Luke xxiv. 41</A>.

 2. Others understand it of the joys and glories of the future state, 
 which the saints shall partake of in everlasting communion with the 
 Lord Jesus, represented here by the pleasures of <I>a banquet of 
 wine.</I> That will be the kingdom of his Father, for unto him shall 
 the kingdom be then delivered up; <I>the wine of consolation</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:7">Jer. xvi. 7</A>)

 will there be always new, never flat or sour, as wine with long 
 keeping; never nauseous or unpleasant, as wine to those that have drank 
 much; but ever fresh. Christ will himself partake of those pleasures;
 it was <I>the joy set before him,</I> which he had in his eye, and all 
 his faithful friends and followers shall partake with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is the close of the solemnity with a hymn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);
 
 <I>They sang a hymn</I> or psalm; whether the psalms which the Jews 
 usually sang at the close of the passover-supper, which they called 
 <I>the great hallel,</I> that is, Ps. 113 and the five that follow it, 
 or whether some new hymn more closely adapted to the occasion, is 
 uncertain; I rather think the former; had it been new, John would not 
 have omitted to record it. Note, 

 1. Singing of psalms is a gospel-ordinance. Christ's removing the hymn
 from the close of the passover to the close of the Lord's supper, 
 plainly intimates that he intended that ordinance should continue in 
 his church, that, as it had not its birth with the ceremonial law, so 
 it should not die with it. 

 2. It is very proper after the Lord's supper, as an expression of our
 joy in God through Jesus Christ, and a thankful acknowledgment of that 
 great love wherewith God has loved us in him. 

 3. It is not unseasonable, no, not in times of sorrow and suffering;
 the disciples were in sorrow, and Christ was entering upon his 
 sufferings, and yet they could sing a hymn together. Our spiritual joy 
 should not be interrupted by outward afflictions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When this was done, they <I>went out into the mount of Olives.</I> He 
 would not stay in the house to be apprehended, lest he should bring the 
 master of the house into trouble; nor would he stay in the city, lest 
 it should occasion an uproar; but he retired into the adjacent country, 
 the mount of Olives, the same mount that David in his distress went 
 <I>up the ascent of, weeping,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:30">2 Sam. xv. 30</A>.

 They had the benefit of moon-light for this walk, for the passover was
 always at the full moon. Note, After we have received the Lord's
 supper, it is good for us to retire for prayer and meditation, and to 
 be alone with God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because
 of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,
 and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
 &nbsp; 32  But after I am risen again, I will go before you into
 Galilee.
 &nbsp; 33  Peter answered and said unto him, Though all <I>men</I> shall be
 offended because of thee, <I>yet</I> will I never be offended.
 &nbsp; 34  Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this
 night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
 &nbsp; 35  Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will
 I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's discourse with his disciples upon the way, as 
 they were going to the mount of Olives. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A prediction of the trial which both he and his disciples were now 
 to go through. He here foretels,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A dismal scattering storm just arising, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they should <I>all be offended because of Christ that very 
 night;</I> that is, they would all be so frightened with the 
 sufferings, that they would not have the courage to cleave to him in 
 them, but would all basely desert him; <I>Because of me this night,</I> 
 <B><I>en emoi en te nykti taute</I></B>--<I>because of me, even because
 of this night;</I> so it might be read; that is, because of what 
 happens to me this night. Note, 

 [1.] Offences will come among the disciples of Christ in an hour of 
 trial and temptation; it cannot be but they should, for they are weak; 
 Satan is busy; God permits offences; even they whose hearts are upright 
 may sometimes be overtaken with an offence. 

 [2.] There are some temptations and offences, the effects of which are 
 general and universal among Christ's disciples; <I>All you shall be 
 offended.</I> Christ had lately discovered to them the treachery of 
 Judas; but let not the rest be secure; though there will be but one 
 traitor, they will be all deserters. This he saith, to alarm them all, 
 that they might all watch.

 [3.] We have need to prepare for sudden trials, which may come to
 extremity in a very little time. Christ and his disciples had eaten
 their supper well together in peace and quietness; yet that very night 
 proved such a night of offence. How soon may a storm arise! We know not 
 what a day, or a night, may bring forth, nor what great event may be in 
 the teeming womb of a little time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:1">Prov. xxvii. 1</A>.

 [4.] The cross of Christ is the great stumbling-block to many that pass
 for his disciples; both the cross he bore for us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:23">1 Cor. i. 23</A>),

 and that which we are called out to bear for him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:24"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That herein the scripture would be fulfilled; <I>I will smite the
 Shepherd.</I> It is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:7">Zech. xiii. 7</A>.

 [1.] Here is the smiting of the Shepherd in the sufferings of Christ.
 God awakens the sword of his wrath against the Son of his love, and he
 is smitten.

 [2.] The scattering of the sheep, thereupon, in the flight of the
 disciples. When Christ fell into the hands of his enemies, his
 disciples ran, one one way and another another; it was each one's care 
 to shift for himself, and happy he that could get furthest from the 
 cross.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives them the prospect of a comfortable gathering together again 
 after this storm 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 "<I>After I am risen again, I will go before you.</I> Though you will 
 forsake me, I will not forsake you; though you fall, I will take care 
 you shall not fall finally: we shall have a meeting again in Galilee, 
 <I>I will go before you,</I> as the shepherd before the sheep." Some 
 make the last words of that prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:7">Zech. xiii. 7</A>),

 a promise equivalent to this here; <I>and I will bring my hand again to 
 the little ones.</I> There is no bringing them back but by bringing his 
 hand to them. Note, The captain of our salvation knows how to rally his 
 troops, when, through their cowardice, they have been put into 
 disorder.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The presumption of Peter, that he should keep his integrity, 
 whatever happened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 <I>Though all men be offended, yet will I never be offended.</I> Peter 
 had a great stock of confidence, and was upon all occasions forward to 
 speak, especially to speak for himself; sometimes it did him a 
 kindness, but at other times it betrayed him, as it did here. Where 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he bound himself with a promise, that he would never be offended 
 in Christ; not only not this night, but at no time. If this promise had 
 been made in a humble dependence upon the grace of Christ, it had been 
 an excellent word. Before the Lord's supper, Christ's discourse led his 
 disciples to <I>examine</I> themselves with, <I>Lord, is it I?</I> For 
 that is our preparatory duty; after the ordinance, his discourse leads 
 them to an <I>engaging</I> of themselves to close walking, for that is 
 the subsequent duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he fancied himself better armed against temptation than any one 
 else, and this was his weakness and folly; <I>Though all men shall be 
 offended yet will not I.</I> This was worse than Hazael's, <I>What! is
 thy servant a dog?</I> For he supposed the thing to be so bad, that no 
 man would do it. But Peter supposes it possible that <I>some,</I> nay 
 that <I>all,</I> might be offended, and yet he escape better than any. 
 Note, It argues a great degree of self-conceit and self-confidence, to 
 think ourselves either safe from the temptations, or free from the 
 corruptions, that are common to men. We should rather say, If it be 
 possible that others may be offended, there is danger that I may be so. 
 But it is common for those who think too well of themselves, easily to 
 admit suspicions of others. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:1">Gal. vi. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The particular warning Christ gave Peter of what he would do, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 He imagined that in the hour of temptation he should come off better 
 than any of them, and Christ tells him that he should come off worse. 
 The warning is introduced with a solemn asseveration; "<I>Verily, I say 
 unto thee;</I> take my word for it, who know thee better than thou 
 knowest thyself." He tells him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he should deny him. Peter promised that he would not be so much 
 as offended in him, not desert him; but Christ tells him that he will 
 go further, he will disown him. He said, "Though all men, yet not I;" 
 and he did it sooner than any.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How quickly he should do it; <I>this night,</I> before to-morrow, 
 nay, <I>before cock-crowing.</I> Satan's temptations are compared to 
 <I>darts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:16">Eph. vi. 16</A>),

 which wound ere we are aware; <I>suddenly doth he shoot.</I> As we know 
 not how near we may be to trouble, so we know not how near we may be to 
 sin; if God leave us to ourselves, we are always in danger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How often he should do it; <I>thrice.</I> He thought that he should 
 never once do such a thing; but Christ tells him that he would do it 
 again and again; for, when once our feet begin to slip, it is hard to 
 recover our standing again. <I>The beginnings of sin are as the letting 
 forth of water.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Peter's repeated assurances of his fidelity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 <I>Though I should die with thee.</I> He supposed the temptation 
 strong, when he said, <I>Though all men do it, yet will not I.</I> But 
 here he supposeth it stronger, when he puts it to the peril of life; 
 <I>Though I should die with thee.</I> He knew what he <I>should</I> 
 do--rather die with Christ than deny him, it was the condition of 
 discipleship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26">Luke xiv. 26</A>);

 and he thought what he <I>would</I> do--never be false to his Master 
 whatever it cost him; yet, it proved, he was. It is easy to talk boldly 
 and carelessly of death at a distance; "I will rather die than do such 
 a thing:" but it is not so soon done as said, when it comes to the 
 setting-to, and death shows itself in its own colours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What Peter said the rest subscribed to; <I>likewise also said all the 
 disciples.</I> Note, 

 1. There is a proneness in good men to be over-confident of their own
 strength and stability. We are ready to think ourselves able to grapple 
 with the strongest temptations, to go through the hardest and most 
 hazardous services, and to bear the greatest afflictions for Christ; 
 but it is because we do not know ourselves. 

 2. Those often fall soonest and foulest that are most confident of
 themselves. Those are least safe that are most secure. Satan is most
 active to seduce such; they are most off their guard, and God leaves 
 them to themselves, to humble them. See

 <FONT SIZE=+1>36  Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane,
 and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray
 yonder.
 &nbsp; 37  And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
 began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
 &nbsp; 38  Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful,
 even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
 &nbsp; 39  And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and
 prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
 from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <I>wilt.</I>
 &nbsp; 40  And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep,
 and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
 &nbsp; 41  Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the
 spirit indeed <I>is</I> willing, but the flesh <I>is</I> weak.
 &nbsp; 42  He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my
 Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it,
 thy will be done.
 &nbsp; 43  And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
 heavy.
 &nbsp; 44  And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
 time, saying the same words.
 &nbsp; 45  Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep
 on now, and take <I>your</I> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and
 the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
 &nbsp; 46  Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth
 betray me.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto, we have seen the preparatives for Christ's sufferings; now, 
 we enter upon the bloody scene. In these verses we have the story of 
 his agony in the garden. This was the beginning of sorrows to our Lord 
 Jesus. Now the <I>sword of the Lord</I> began to awake against <I>the 
 man that was his Fellow; and how should it be quiet when the Lord had 
 given it a charge?</I> The clouds had been gathering a good while, and 
 looked black. He had said, some days before, <I>Now is my soul 
 troubled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:27">John xii. 27</A>.

 But now the storm began in good earnest. He put himself into this
 agony, before his enemies gave him any trouble, to show that he was a 
 Freewill offering; that his life was not forced from him, but he 
 <I>laid it down of himself.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:18">John x. 18</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The place where he underwent this mighty agony; it was <I>in a place 
 called Gethsemane.</I> The name signifies, <I>torculus olei--an
 olive-mill,</I> a press for olives, like a wine-press, where they 
 <I>trod the olives,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:15">Mic. vi. 15</A>.

 And this was the proper place for such a thing, at the foot of the
 mount of Olives. There our Lord Jesus began his passion; there it 
 pleased the Lord to bruise him, and crush him, that fresh oil might 
 flow to all believers from him, that we might partake of the root and 
 fatness of that <I>good Olive.</I> There he trod the wine-press of his 
 Father's wrath, and trod it alone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The company he had with him, when he was in this agony.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He took all the twelve disciples with him to the garden, except 
 Judas, who was at this time otherwise employed. Though it was late in 
 the night, near bed-time, yet they kept with him, and took this walk by 
 moonlight with him, as Elisha, who, when he was told that his master 
 should shortly be taken from his head, declared that he <I>would not 
 leave him,</I> though he <I>led him about;</I> so these follow the 
 Lamb, wheresoever he goes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He took only Peter, and James, and John, with him into that corner 
 of the garden where he suffered his agony. He left the rest at some 
 distance, perhaps at the garden door, with this charge, <I>Sit ye here, 
 while I go and pray yonder;</I> like that of Abraham to his <I>young 
 men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:5">Gen. xxii. 5</A>),

 <I>Abide ye here, and I will go yonder and worship.</I> 

 (1.) Christ went to pray alone, though he had lately prayed with his 
 disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1">John xvii. 1</A>.

 Note, Our prayers with our families must not excuse us from our secret
 devotions.

 (2.) He ordered them to sit here. Note, We must take heed
 of giving any disturbance or interruption to those who retire for 
 secret communion with God. He took these three with him, because they 
 had been the witnesses of his glory in his transfiguration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:1,2"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 1, 2</A>),

 and that would prepare them to be the witnesses of his agony. Note,
 Those are best prepared to suffer with Christ, that have by faith 
 beheld his glory, and have conversed with the glorified saints upon the 
 holy mount. <I>If we suffer with Christ, we shall reign with him;</I>
 and if we hope to reign with him, why should we not expect to suffer 
 with him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The agony itself that he was in; <I>He began to be sorrowful, and 
 very heavy.</I> It is called an agony 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:44">Luke xxii. 44</A>),

 a conflict. It was not any bodily pain or torment that he was in, 
 nothing occurred to hurt him; but, whatever it was, it was from within; 
 he troubled himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:33">John xi. 33</A>.

 The words here used are very emphatical; he began <B><I>lupeisthai kai
 ademunein</I></B>--<I>to be sorrowful, and in a consternation.</I> The
 latter word signifies such a sorrow as makes a man neither fit for
 company nor desirous of it. He had like a weight of lead upon his
 spirits. Physicians use a word near akin to it, to signify the disorder
 a man is in in a fit of an ague, or beginning of a fever. Now was
 fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:14">Ps. xxii. 14</A>,

 <I>I am poured out like water, my heart is like wax, it is melted;</I>
 and all those passages in the Psalms where David complains of the 
 sorrows of his soul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:4,5,42:7,55:4,5,69:1-3.88:3,116:3">Ps. xviii. 4, 5;
 xlii. 7; lv. 4, 5; lxix. 1-3; lxxxviii. 3; cxvi. 3</A>,
 
 and Jonah's complaint,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:4,5"><I>ch.</I> ii. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But what was the cause of all this? What was it that put him into his 
 agony? <I>Why art thou cast down,</I> blessed Jesus, and <I>why 
 disquieted?</I> Certainly, it was nothing of despair or distrust of his 
 Father, much less any conflict or struggle with him. As the Father 
 loved him because he laid down his life for the sheep, so he was 
 entirely subject to his Father's will in it. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He engaged in an encounter with the powers of darkness; so he 
 intimates 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:53">Luke xxii. 53</A>);

 <I>This is your hour, and the power of darkness:</I> and he spoke of it 
 just before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:30,31">John xiv. 30, 31</A>);

 "<I>The prince of this world cometh.</I> I see him rallying his forces, 
 and preparing for a general assault; but <I>he has nothing in me,</I> 
 no garrisons in his interest, none that secretly hold correspondence 
 with him; and therefore his attempts, though fierce, will be fruitless: 
 but <I>as the Father gave me commandment, so I do;</I> however it be, I 
 must have a struggle with him, the field must be fairly fought; and 
 therefore <I>arise, let us go hence,</I> let us hasten to the field of 
 battle, and meet the enemy." Now is the close engagement in single 
 combat between Michael and the dragon, hand to hand; <I>now is the 
 judgment of this world;</I> the great cause is now to be determined, 
 and the decisive battle fought, in which the <I>prince of this 
 world,</I> will certainly be beaten and <I>cast out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:31">John xii. 31</A>.
 
 Christ, when he works salvation, is described like a champion taking
 the field, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:16-18">Isa. lix. 16-18</A>.

 Now the serpent makes his fiercest onset on the seed of the woman, and
 directs his sting, the sting of death, to his very heart; <I>animamque 
 in vulnere ponit--and the wound is mortal.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was now <I>bearing the iniquities</I> which the Father laid upon 
 him, and, by his sorrow and amazement, he accommodated himself to his 
 undertaking. The sufferings he was entering upon were for our sins; 
 they were all made to meet upon him, and he knew it. As we are obliged 
 to be sorry for our particular sins, so was he grieved for the sins of 
 us all. So Bishop Pearson, p. 191. Now, <I>in the valley of 
 Jehoshaphat,</I> where Christ now was, God <I>gathered all nations,</I> 
 and <I>pleaded with them in his</I> Son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+3:2,12">Joel iii. 2, 12</A>.

 He knew the malignity of the sins that were laid upon him, how
 provoking to God, how ruining to man; and these being all set in order 
 before him, and charged upon him, he was <I>sorrowful and very 
 heavy.</I> Now it was that <I>iniquities took hold on him;</I> so that 
 he was <I>not able to look up,</I> as was foretold concerning him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:7,12">Ps. xl. 7, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He had a full and clear prospect of all the sufferings that were 
 before him. He foresaw the treachery of Judas, the unkindness of Peter, 
 the malice of the Jews, and their base ingratitude. He knew that he 
 should now in a few hours be scourged, spit upon, crowned with thorns, 
 nailed to the cross; death in its most dreadful appearances, death in 
 pomp, attended with all its terrors, looked him in the face; and this 
 made him sorrowful, especially because it was the wages of our sin, 
 which he had undertaken to satisfy for. It is true, the martyrs that 
 have suffered for Christ, have entertained the greatest torments, and 
 the most terrible deaths, without any such sorrow and consternation; 
 have called their prisons their delectable orchards, and a bed of 
 flames a bed of roses: but then, 

 (1.) Christ was now denied the supports and comforts which they had; 
 that is, he denied them to himself, and <I>his soul refused to be 
 comforted,</I> not in passion, but in justice to his undertaking. Their 
 cheerfulness under the cross was owing to the divine favour, which, for 
 the present, was suspended from the Lord Jesus. 

 (2.) His sufferings were of another nature from theirs. St. Paul, when 
 he is to be offered upon the sacrifice and service of the saints' 
 faith, can <I>joy and rejoice with them all;</I> but to be offered a 
 sacrifice, to make atonement for sin, is quite a different case. On the 
 saints' cross there is a blessing pronounced, which enables them to 
 rejoice under it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:10,12"><I>ch.</I> v. 10, 12</A>);

 but to Christ's cross there was a curse annexed, which made him
 sorrowful and very heavy under it. And his sorrow under the cross was 
 the foundation of their joy under it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His complaint of this agony. Finding himself under the arrest of 
 his passion, he goes to his disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),
 
 and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He acquaints them with his condition; <I>My soul is exceedingly 
 sorrowful, even unto death.</I> It gives some little ease to a troubled 
 spirit, to have a friend ready to unbosom itself to, and give vent to 
 its sorrows. Christ here tells them, 

 (1.) What was the seat of his sorrow; it was his soul that was now in 
 an agony. This proves that Christ had a true human soul; for he 
 suffered, not only in his body, but in his soul. We had sinned both 
 against our own bodies, and against our souls; both had been used in 
 sin, and both had been wronged by it; and therefore Christ suffered in 
 soul as well as in body. 

 (2.) What was the degree of his sorrow. He was <I>exceedingly 
 sorrowful,</I> <B><I>perilypos</I></B>--<I>compassed about with sorrow 
 on all hands.</I> It was sorrow in the highest degree, even unto death; 
 it was a killing sorrow, such sorrow as no mortal man could bear and 
 live. He was ready to die for grief; they were sorrows of death. 

 (3.) The duration of it; it will continue even unto death. "My soul 
 will be sorrowful as long as it is in this body; I see no outlet but 
 death." He now <I>began</I> to be sorrowful, and never ceased to be so 
 till he said, <I>It is finished;</I> that grief is now finished, which 
 began in the garden. It was prophesied of Christ, that he should be 
 <I>a Man of sorrows</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:3">Isa. liii. 3</A>);

 he was so all along, we never read that he laughed; but all his sorrows 
 hitherto were nothing to this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He bespeaks their company and attendance; <I>Tarry ye here, and 
 watch with me.</I> Surely he was destitute indeed of help, when he 
 entreated theirs, who, he knew, would be but miserable comforters; but 
 he would hereby teach us the benefit of the communion of saints. It is 
 good to have, and therefore good to seek, the assistance of our 
 brethren, when at any time we are in an agony; <I>for two are better 
 than one.</I> What he said to them, he saith to all, <I>Watch,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:37">Mark xiii. 37</A>.

 Not only watch for him, in expectation of his future coming, but watch
 with him, in application to our present work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. What passed between him and his Father when he was in this agony; 
 <I>Being in an agony, he prayed.</I> Prayer is never out of season, but 
 it is especially seasonable in an agony.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. The place where he prayed; <I>He went a little further,</I> withdrew
 from them, that the scripture might be fulfilled, <I>I have trod the 
 wine-press alone;</I> he retired for prayer; a troubled soul finds most 
 ease when it is alone with God, who understands the broken language of 
 sighs and groans. Calvin's devout remark upon this is worth 
 transcribing, <I>Utile est seorsim orare, tunc enim magis familiariter 
 sese denudat fidelis animus, et simplicius sua vota, gemitus, curas, 
 pavores, spes, et gaudia in Dei sinum exonerat--It is useful to pray 
 apart; for then the faithful soul develops itself more familiarly, and 
 with greater simplicity pours forth its petitions, groans, cares, 
 fears, hopes and joys, into the bosom of God.</I> Christ has hereby 
 taught us that secret prayer must be made secretly. Yet some think that 
 even the disciples whom he left at the garden door, overheard him; for 
 it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>),
 
 they were <I>strong cries.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His posture in prayer; <I>He fell on his face;</I> his lying 
 prostrate denotes, 

 (1.) The agony he was in, and the extremity of his sorrow. Job, in 
 great grief, <I>fell on the ground;</I> and great anguish is expressed 
 by <I>rolling in the dust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:10">Mic. i. 10</A>.

 (2.) His humility in prayer. This posture was an expression of his,
 <B><I>eulabeia</I></B>--<I>his reverential fear</I> (spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>),

 with which he offered up these prayers: and it was <I>in the days of 
 his flesh,</I> in his estate of humiliation, to which hereby he 
 accommodated himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The prayer itself; wherein we may observe three things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The title he gives to God; <I>O my Father.</I> Thick as the cloud 
 was, he could see God as a Father through it. Note, In all our 
 addresses to God we should eye him as a Father, as our Father; and it 
 is in a special manner comfortable to do so, when we are in an agony. 
 It is a pleasing string to harp upon at such a time, <I>My Father;</I> 
 whither should the child go, when any thing grieves him, but to his 
 father?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The favour he begs; <I>If it be possible, let this cup pass from 
 me.</I> He calls his sufferings a <I>cup;</I> not a river, not a sea, 
 but a cup, which we shall soon see the bottom of. When we are under 
 troubles, we should make the best, the least, of them, and not 
 aggravate them. His sufferings might be called a <I>cup,</I> because 
 allotted him, as at feasts a cup was set to every mess. He begs that 
 this cup might <I>pass from him,</I> that is, that he might avoid the 
 sufferings now at hand; or, at least, that they might be shortened. 
 This intimates no more than that he was really and truly Man, and as a 
 Man he could not but be averse to pain and suffering. This is the first 
 and simple act of man's will--to start back from that which is sensibly
 grievous to us, and to desire the prevention and removal of it. The law 
 of self-preservation is impressed upon the innocent nature of man, and 
 rules there till overruled by some other law; therefore Christ admitted 
 and expressed a reluctance to suffer, to show that he was <I>taken from 
 among men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:1">Heb. v. 1</A>),

 was touched with <I>the feeling of our infirmities</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:15">Heb. iv. 15</A>),

 and <I>tempted as we are; yet without sin.</I> Note, A prayer of faith 
 against an affliction, may very well consist with the patience of hope 
 under affliction. When David had said, <I>I was dumb, I opened not my 
 mouth, because thou didst it;</I> his very next words were, <I>Remove 
 thy stroke away from me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:9,10">Ps. xxxix. 9, 10</A>.

 But observe the proviso; <I>If it be possible.</I> If God may be
 glorified, man saved, and the ends of his undertaking answered, without 
 his drinking of this bitter cup, he desires to be excused; otherwise 
 not. What we cannot do with the securing of our great end, we must 
 reckon to be in effect impossible; Christ did so. <I>Id possumus quod 
 jure possumus--We can do that which we can do lawfully.</I> We 
 <I>can</I> do nothing, not only we <I>may</I> do nothing, against the 
 truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) His entire submission to, and acquiescence in, the will of God; 
 <I>Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</I> Not that the 
 human will of Christ was adverse or averse to the divine will; it was 
 only, in its first act, diverse from it; to which, in the second act of 
 the will, which compares and chooses, he freely submits himself. Note, 
 
 [1.] Our Lord Jesus, though he had a quick sense of the extreme 
 bitterness of the sufferings he was to undergo, yet was freely willing 
 to submit to them for our redemption and salvation, and <I>offered 
 himself, and gave himself, for us.</I> 

 [2.] The reason of Christ's submission to his sufferings, was, his 
 Father's will; <I>as thou wilt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 He grounds his own willingness upon the Father's will, and resolves the 
 matter wholly into that; <I>therefore</I> he did what he did, and did 
 it with delight, because it was the will of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:8">Ps. xl. 8</A>.

 This he had often referred to, as that which put him upon, and carried 
 him through, his whole undertaking; <I>This is the Father's will,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:39,40">John vi. 39, 40</A>.

 This he sought

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:30">John v. 30</A>);

 it was his <I>meat and drink</I> to do it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:34">John iv. 34</A>.

 [3.] In conformity to this example of Christ, we must drink
 of the bitter cup which God puts into our hands, be it ever so bitter; 
 though nature struggle, grace must submit. We then are disposed as 
 Christ was, when our wills are in every thing melted into the will of 
 God, though ever so displeasing to flesh and blood; <I>The will of the 
 Lord be done,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:14">Acts xxi. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The repetition of the prayer; <I>He went away again the second time, 
 and prayed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>),

 and again the third time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>),

 and all to the same purport; only, as it is related here, he did not, 
 in the second and third prayer, expressly ask that the cup might pass 
 from him, as he had done in the first. Note, Though we may pray to God 
 to prevent and remove an affliction, yet our chief errand, and that 
 which we should most insist upon, must be, that he will give us grace 
 to bear it well. It should be more our care to get our troubles 
 sanctified, and our hearts satisfied under them, than to get them taken 
 away. <I>He prayed, saying, Thy will be done.</I> Note, Prayer is the 
 offering up, not only of our desires, but of our resignations, to God. 
 It amounts to an acceptable prayer, when at any time we are in 
 distress, to refer ourselves to God, and to commit our way and work to 
 him; <I>Thy will be done.</I> The third time he <I>said the same 
 words,</I> <B><I>ton auton logon</I></B>--<I>the same word,</I> that is 
 the same matter or argument; he spoke to the same purport. We have 
 reason to think that this was not all he said, for it should seem by 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>

 that he continued <I>an hour</I> in his agony and prayer; but, whatever 
 more he said, it was to this effect, deprecating his approaching 
 sufferings, and yet resigning himself to God's will in them, in the 
 expressions of which we may be sure he was not straitened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But what answer had he to this prayer? Certainly it was not made in 
 vain; he that heard him <I>always,</I> did not deny him <I>now.</I> It 
 is true, the cup did not pass from him, for he withdrew that petition, 
 and did not insist upon it (if he had, for aught I know, the cup had 
 passed away); but he had an answer to his prayer; for, 

 (1.) <I>He was strengthened with strength in his soul,</I> in the day 
 when he cried 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:3">Ps. cxxxviii. 3</A>);
 
 and that was a real answer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:43">Luke xxii. 43</A>.

 (2.) He was delivered from that which he feared, which was, lest by 
 impatience and distrust he should offend his Father, and so disable 
 himself to go on with his undertaking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.

 In answer to his prayer, God provided that he should not fail or be
 discouraged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. What passed between him and his three disciples at this time; and 
 here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The fault they were guilty of; that when he was in his agony, 
 sorrowful and heavy, sweating and wrestling and praying, they were so 
 little concerned, that they could not keep awake; he comes, and 
 <I>finds them asleep,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 The strangeness of the thing should have roused their spirits to 
 <I>turn aside now, and see this great sight--the bush burning, and yet 
 not consumed;</I> much more should their love to their Master, and 
 their care concerning him, have obliged them to a more close and 
 vigilant attendance on him; yet they were so dull, that they could not 
 keep their eyes open. What had become of us, if Christ had been now as 
 sleepy as his disciples were? It is well for us that our salvation is 
 in the hand of one who <I>neither slumbers nor sleeps.</I> Christ 
 engaged them to watch with him, as if he expected some succour from 
 them, and yet they slept; surely it was the unkindest thing that could 
 be. When David wept at this mount of Olives, all his followers wept 
 with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:30">2 Sam. xv. 30</A>);

 but when the Son of David was here in tears, his followers were asleep. 
 His enemies, who watched for him, were wakeful enough 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:43">Mark xiv. 43</A>);

 but his disciples, who should have watched with him, were asleep. Lord, 
 what is man! What are the best of men, when God leaves them to 
 themselves! Note, Carelessness and carnal security, especially when 
 Christ is in his agony, are great faults in any, but especially in 
 those who profess to be nearest in relation to him. The church of 
 Christ, which is his body, is often in an agony, fightings without and 
 fears within; and shall we be asleep then, like Gallio, that <I>cared 
 for none of these things;</I> or those 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:6">Amos vi. 6</A>)

 that <I>lay at ease, and were not grieved for the affliction of 
 Joseph?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ's favour to them, notwithstanding. Persons in sorrow are too 
 apt to be cross and peevish with those about them, and to lay it 
 grievously to heart, if they but seem to neglect them; but Christ in 
 his agony is as meek as ever, and carries it as patiently toward his 
 followers as toward his Father, and is not apt to take things ill.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When Christ's disciples put this slight upon him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>He came to them,</I> as if he expected to receive some comfort 
 from them; and if they had put him in mind of what they had heard from 
 him concerning his resurrection and glory perhaps it might have been 
 some help to him; but, instead of that, they added grief to his sorrow; 
 and yet he came to them, more careful for them than they were for 
 themselves; when he was most engaged, yet he came to look after them; 
 for those that were given him, were upon his heart, living and 
 dying.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He gave them a gentle reproof, for as many as he loves he rebukes; 
 he directed it to Peter, who used to <I>speak</I> for them; let him now 
 <I>hear</I> for them. The reproof was very melting; <I>What! could ye 
 not watch with me one hour?</I> He speaks as one amazed to see them so 
 stupid; every word, when closely considered, shows the aggravated 
 nature of the case. Consider, 

 [1.] Who <I>they</I> were; "Could not <I>ye</I> watch--ye, my disciples 
 and followers? No wonder if others neglect me, if <I>the earth sit 
 still, and be at rest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:11">Zech. i. 11</A>);

 but from you I expected better things."

 [2.] Who <I>he</I> was; "Watch with <I>me.</I> If one of yourselves 
 were ill and in an agony, it would be very unkind not to watch with 
 him; but it is undutiful not to watch with your Master, who has long 
 watched over you for good, has led you, and fed you, and taught you, 
 borne you, and borne with you; do ye thus requite him?" He awoke out of 
 his sleep, to help them when they were in distress

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:26"><I>ch.</I> viii. 26</A>);

 and could not they keep awake, at least to show their good-will to him,
 especially considering that he was now suffering <I>for them,</I> in an
 agony <I>for them? Jam tua res agiture--I am suffering in your
 cause.</I> 

 [3.] How small a thing it was that he expected from them--only to 
 <I>watch with him.</I> If he had bid them do some great thing, had bid 
 them be in an agony with him, or die with him, they thought they could 
 have done it; and yet they could not do it, when he only desired them 
 to <I>watch with him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:13">2 Kings v. 13</A>.

 [4.] How short a time it was that he expected it--but <I>one hour;</I>
 they were not set upon the guard whole nights, as the prophet was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:8">Isa. xxi. 8</A>),

 only <I>one hour.</I> Sometimes he <I>continued all night in prayer to
 God,</I> but did not then expect that his disciples should watch with 
 him; only now, when he had but one hour to spend in prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He gave them good counsel; <I>Watch and pray, that ye enter not 
 into temptation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 [1.] There was an hour of temptation drawing on, and very near; the 
 troubles of Christ were temptations to his followers to disbelieve and 
 distrust him, to deny and desert him, and renounce all relation to him. 
 
 [2.] There was danger of their entering into the temptation, as into a 
 snare or trap; of their entering into a parley with it, or a good 
 opinion of it, of their being influenced by it, and inclining to comply 
 with it; which is the first step toward being overcome by it. 

 [3.] He therefore exhorts them to watch and pray; <I>Watch with me, and 
 pray with me.</I> While they were sleeping, they lost the benefit of 
 joining in Christ's prayer. "Watch <I>yourselves,</I> and pray 
 <I>yourselves.</I> Watch and pray against this present temptation to 
 drowsiness and security; <I>pray</I> that you may <I>watch;</I> beg of 
 God by his grace to keep you awake, now that there is occasion." When 
 we are drowsy in the worship of God, we should pray, as a good 
 Christian once did, "The Lord deliver me from this sleepy devil!" 
 <I>Lord, quicken thou me in thy way,</I> Or, "Watch and pray against 
 the further temptation you may be assaulted with; <I>watch and pray</I> 
 lest this sin prove the inlet of many more." Note, When we find 
 ourselves entering into temptation, we have need to watch and pray.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He kindly excused for them; <I>The spirit indeed is willing, but 
 the flesh is weak.</I> We do not read of one word they had to say for 
 themselves (the sense of their own weakness stopped their mouth); but 
 then he had a tender word to say on their behalf, for it is his office 
 to be an Advocate; in this he sets us an example of the love <I>which 
 covers a multitude of sins.</I> He considered their frame, and did not 
 chide them, for he remembered that they were but flesh; <I>and the 
 flesh is weak, though the spirit be willing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:38,39">Ps. lxxviii. 38, 39</A>.
 
 Note,

 [1.] Christ's disciples, as long as they are here in this world, have
 bodies as well as souls, and a principle of remaining corruption as 
 well as of reigning grace, like Jacob and Esau in the same womb, 
 <I>Canaanites</I> and <I>Israelites</I> in the same land, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:17,24">Gal. v. 17, 24</A>.

 [2.] It is the unhappiness and burthen of Christ's disciples, that 
 their bodies cannot keep pace with their souls in works of piety and 
 devotion, but are many a time a cloud and clog to them; that, when the 
 spirit is free and disposed to that which is good, the flesh is averse 
 and indisposed. This St. Paul laments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:25">Rom. vii. 25</A>);

 <I>With my mind I serve the law of God, but with my flesh the law of 
 sin.</I> Our impotency in the service of God is the great iniquity and 
 infidelity of our nature, and it arises from these sad remainders of 
 corruption, which are the constant grief and burthen of God's people.

 [3.] Yet it is our comfort, that our Master graciously considers this, 
 and accepts the willingness of the spirit, and pities and pardons the 
 weakness and infirmity of the flesh; for <I>we are under grace, and not 
 under the law.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Though they continued dull and sleepy, he did not any further 
 rebuke them for it; for, though we daily offend, yet he will not always 
 chide. 

 [1.] When he came to them the second time, we do not find that he said 
 any thing to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>);

 <I>he findeth them asleep again.</I> One would have thought that he had 
 said enough to them to keep them awake; but it is hard to recover from 
 a spirit of slumber. Carnal security, when once it prevails, is not 
 easily shaken off. <I>Their eyes were heavy,</I> which intimates that 
 they strove against it as much as they could, but were overcome by it, 
 like the spouse; <I>I sleep, but my heart waketh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:2">Cant. v. 2</A>);

 and therefore their Master looked upon them with compassion. 

 [2.] When he came the third time, he left them to be alarmed with the 
 approaching danger 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:45,46"><I>v.</I> 45, 46</A>);

 <I>Sleep on now, and take your rest.</I> This is spoken ironically; 
 "Now sleep if you can, sleep if you dare; I would not disturb you if 
 Judas and his band of men would not." See here how Christ deals with 
 those that suffer themselves to be overcome by security, and will not 
 be awakened out of it. <I>First,</I> Sometimes he gives them up to the 
 power of it; <I>Sleep on now.</I> He that will sleep, let him sleep 
 still. The curse of spiritual slumber is the just punishment of the sin 
 of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8,Ho+4:17">Rom. xi. 8; Hos. iv. 17</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Many times he sends some startling judgment, to awaken
 those that would not be wrought upon by the word; and those who will 
 not be alarmed by reasons and arguments, had better be alarmed by 
 swords and spears than left to perish in their security. Let those that 
 would not believe, be made to feel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to the disciples here, 

 1. Their Master gave them notice of the near approach of his enemies,
 who, it is likely, were now within sight or hearing, for they came with 
 candles and torches, and, it is likely, made a great noise; <I>The Son 
 of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</I> And again, <I>He is 
 at hand that doth betray me.</I> Note, Christ's sufferings were no 
 surprise to him; he knew what, and when, he was to suffer. By this time 
 the extremity of his agony was pretty well over, or, at least, 
 diverted; while with an undaunted courage he addresses himself to the 
 next encounter, as a champion to the combat.

 2. He called them to rise, and be going: not, "Rise, and let us flee
 from the danger;" but, "Rise, and let us go meet it;" before he had
 prayed, he feared his sufferings, but now he had got over his fears.
 But, 

 3. He intimates to them their folly, in sleeping away the time which
 they should have spent in preparation; now the event found them 
 unready, and was a terror to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>47  And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came,
 and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the
 chief priests and elders of the people.
 &nbsp; 48  Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying,
 Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
 &nbsp; 49  And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
 kissed him.
 &nbsp; 50  And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come?
 Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
 &nbsp; 51  And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
 <I>his</I> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high
 priest's, and smote off his ear.
 &nbsp; 52  Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
 place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
 sword.
 &nbsp; 53  Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
 shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
 &nbsp; 54  But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it
 must be?
 &nbsp; 55  In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come
 out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I
 sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on
 me.
 &nbsp; 56  But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets
 might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told how the blessed Jesus was seized, and taken into 
 custody; this followed immediately upon his agony, <I>while he yet 
 spake;</I> for from the beginning to the close of his passion he had 
 not the least intermission or breathing-time, but <I>deep called unto 
 deep.</I> His trouble hitherto was raised within himself; but now the 
 scene is changed, now the Philistines are upon thee, thou blessed 
 Samson; <I>the Breath of our nostrils, the Anointed of the Lord is 
 taken in their pits,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:20">Lam. iv. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now concerning the apprehension of the Lord Jesus, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who the persons were, that were employed in it. 

 1. Here was <I>Judas, one of the twelve,</I> at the head of this
 infamous guard: <I>he was guide to them that took Jesus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:16">Acts i. 16</A>);

 without his help they could not have found him in this retirement. 
 Behold, and wonder; the first that appears with his enemies, is one of 
 his own disciples, who an hour or two ago was eating bread with him! 

 2. Here was <I>with him a great multitude;</I> that the scripture
 might be fulfilled, <I>Lord, how are they increased that trouble 
 me!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:1">Ps. iii. 1</A>.

 This multitude was made up partly of a detachment out of the guards,
 that were posted in the tower of Antonia by the Roman governor; these 
 were Gentiles, <I>sinners,</I> as Christ calls them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 The rest were the servants and officers of the High Priest, and they
 were Jews; they that were at variance with each other, agreed against 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they were armed for this enterprise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What weapons they were armed with; They came <I>with swords and 
 staves.</I> The Roman soldiers, no doubt, had swords; the servants of 
 the priests, those of them that had not swords, brought staves or 
 clubs. <I>Furor arma ministrat--Their rage supplied their arms.</I> They
 were not regular troops, but a tumultuous rabble. But wherefore is this 
 ado? If they had been ten times as many, they could not have taken him 
 had he not yielded; and, his hour being come for him to give up 
 himself, all this force was needless. When a butcher goes into the 
 field to take out a lamb for the slaughter, does he raise the militia, 
 and come armed? No, he needs not; yet is there all this force used to 
 seize the Lamb of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What warrant they were armed with; <I>They came from the chief 
 priests, and elders of the people;</I> this armed multitude was sent by 
 them upon this errand. He was taken up by a warrant from the great 
 sanhedrim, as a person obnoxious to them. Pilate, the Roman governor,
 gave them no warrant to search for him, he had no jealousy of him; but 
 they were men who pretended to religion, and presided in the affairs of 
 the church, that were active in this prosecution, and were the most 
 spiteful enemies Christ had. It was a sign that he was supported by a 
 divine power, for by all earthly powers he was not only deserted, but 
 opposed; Pilate upbraided him with it; <I>Thine own nation and the 
 chief priests delivered thee to me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:35">John xviii. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The manner how it was done, and what passed at that time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How Judas betrayed him; he did his business effectually, and his 
 resolution in this wickedness may shame us who fail in that which is 
 good. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The instructions he gave to the soldiers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>);

 <I>He gave them a sign;</I> as commander of the party in this action, 
 he gives the word or signal. He <I>gave them a sign,</I> lest by 
 mistake they should seize one of the disciples instead of him, the 
 disciples having so lately said, in Judas's hearing, that they would be 
 willing to die for him. What abundance of caution was here, not to miss 
 him--<I>That same is he;</I> and when they had him in their hands, not 
 to lose him--<I>Hold him fast;</I> for he had sometimes escaped from 
 those who thought to secure him; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:30">Luke vi. 30</A>.

 Though the Jews, who frequented the temple, could not but know him, yet
 the Roman soldiers perhaps had never seen him, and the sign was to 
 direct them; and Judas by his kiss intended not only to distinguish 
 him, but to detain him, while they came behind him, and laid hands on 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The dissembling compliment he gave his Master. He came close up to 
 Jesus; surely now, if ever, his wicked heart will relent; surely when 
 he comes to look him in the face, he will either be awed by its 
 majesty, or charmed by its beauty. Dares he to come into his very sight 
 and presence, to betray him? Peter denied Christ, but when <I>the Lord 
 turned and looked</I> upon him, he relented presently; but Judas comes 
 up to his Master's face, and betrays him. <I>Me mihi (perfide) prodis? 
 me mihi prodis?--Perfidious man, betrayest thou me to thyself?</I> He
 said, <I>Hail, Master; and kissed him.</I> It should seem, our Lord 
 Jesus had been wont to admit his disciples to such a degree of 
 familiarity with him, as to give them his cheek to kiss after they had 
 been any while absent, which Judas villainously used to facilitate this 
 treason. A kiss is a token of allegiance and friendship, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:12">Ps. ii. 12</A>.

 But Judas, when he broke all the laws of love and duty, profaned this
 sacred sign to serve his purpose. Note, There are many that betray 
 Christ with <I>a kiss,</I> and <I>Hail, Master;</I> who, under pretence 
 of doing him honour, betray and undermine the interests of his kingdom.
 <I>Mel in ore, fel in corde--Honey in the mouth, gall in the heart.</I> 
 <B><I>Kataphilein ouk esti philein.</I></B> <I>To embrace is one thing, 
 to love is another. Philo Jud&aelig;us.</I> Joab's kiss and Judas's 
 were much alike.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The entertainment his Master gave him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He calls him <I>friend.</I> If he had called him <I>villain,</I> 
 and <I>traitor, raca, thou fool,</I> and <I>child of the devil,</I> he 
 had not <I>mis--</I>called him; but he would teach us under the greatest
 provocation to forbear bitterness and evil-speaking, and to show all 
 meekness. <I>Friend,</I> for a friend he had been, and should have 
 been, and seemed to be. Thus he upbraids him, as Abraham, when he 
 called the rich man in hell, <I>son.</I> He calls him <I>friend,</I> 
 because he furthered his sufferings, and so <I>befriended</I> him; 
 whereas, he called Peter <I>Satan</I> for attempting to hinder 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He asks him, "<I>Wherefore art thou come?</I> Is it peace, Judas? 
 Explain thyself; if thou come as an enemy, what means this kiss? If as 
 a friend, what mean these swords and staves? <I>Wherefore art thou 
 come?</I> What harm have I done thee? Wherein have I wearied thee?
 <B><I>eph ho parei</I></B>--<I>Wherefore art thou present?</I> Why hadst
 thou not so much shame left thee, as to keep out of sight, which thou 
 mightest have done, and yet have given the officer notice where I was?" 
 This was an instance of great impudence, for him to be so forward and 
 barefaced in this wicked transaction. But it is usual for apostates 
 from religion to be the most bitter enemies to it; witness Julian. Thus 
 Judas did his part.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How the officers and soldiers secured him; <I>Then came they, and 
 laid hands on Jesus, and took him;</I> they made him their prisoner. 
 <I>How were they not afraid to stretch forth their hands against the 
 Lord's Anointed?</I> We may well imagine what rude and cruel hands they 
 were, which this barbarous multitude laid on Christ; and how, it is 
 probable, they handled him the more roughly for their being so often 
 disappointed when they sought to lay hands on him. They could not have 
 taken him, if he had not surrendered himself, and been <I>delivered by 
 the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.

 He who said concerning his anointed servants, <I>Touch them not,</I>
 and <I>do them no harm</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:14,15">Ps. cv. 14, 15</A>),

 <I>spared not his anointed Son, but delivered him up for us all;</I> 
 and again, <I>gave his strength into captivity, his glory into the 
 enemies' hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:61">Ps. lxxviii. 61</A>.
 
 See what was the complaint of Job

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:11"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 11</A>),

 <I>God hath delivered me to the ungodly,</I> and apply that and other
 passages in that book of Job as a type of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus was made a prisoner, because he would in all things be 
 treated as a malefactor, punished for our crime, and as a surety under 
 arrest for our debt. The yoke of our transgressions was bound by the 
 Father's hand upon the neck of the Lord Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:14">Lam. i. 14</A>.

 He became a prisoner, that he might set us at liberty; for he said,
 <I>If ye seek me, let these go their way</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:8">John xviii. 8</A>);

 and those are free indeed, whom he makes so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How Peter fought for Christ, and was checked for his pains. It is 
 here only said to be <I>one of them that were with Jesus in the 
 garden;</I> but 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:10">John xviii. 10</A>,

 we are told that it was Peter who signalized himself upon this
 occasion. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Peter's rashness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>);

 He <I>drew his sword.</I> They had but two swords among them all 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:38">Luke xxii. 38</A>),

 and one of them, it seems, fell to Peter's share; and now he thought it 
 was time to draw it, and he laid about him as if he would have done 
 some great matter; but all the execution he did was the cutting off an 
 ear from a servant of the High Priest; designing, it is likely, to 
 cleave him down the head, because he saw him more forward than the rest 
 in laying hands on Christ, he missed his blow. But if he would be
 striking, in my mind he should rather have aimed at Judas, and have 
 marked him for a rogue. Peter had talked much of what he would do for 
 his Master, he would <I>lay down his life for him;</I> yea, that he 
 would; and now he would be as good as his word, and venture his life to 
 rescue his Master: and thus far was commendable, that he had a great 
 <I>zeal</I> for Christ, and his honour and safety; but it was not 
 <I>according to knowledge,</I> nor guided by discretion; for

 [1.] He did it without warrant; some of the disciples asked indeed,
 <I>Shall we smite with the sword?</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:49">Luke xxii. 49</A>)

 But Peter struck before they had an answer. We must see not only our
 cause good, but our call clear, before we draw the sword; we must show 
 by what authority we do it, and who gave us that authority.

 [2.] He indiscreetly exposed himself and his fellow-disciples to the
 rage of the multitude; for what could they with two swords do against a 
 band of men?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The rebuke which our Lord Jesus gave him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>);

 <I>Put up again thy sword into its place.</I> He does not command the 
 officers and soldiers to put up their swords that were drawn against 
 him, he left them to the judgment of God, who judges them that are 
 without; but he commands Peter to put up his sword, does not chide him 
 indeed for what he had done, because done out of good will, but stops 
 the progress of his arms, and provides that it should not be drawn into 
 a precedent. Christ's errand into the world was to make peace. Note,
 <I>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but spiritual;</I> and 
 Christ's ministers, though they are his soldiers, do not <I>war after 
 the flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:3,4">2 Cor. x. 3, 4</A>.

 Not that the law of Christ overthrows either the law of nature of the
 law of nations, as far as those warrant subjects to stand up in defence 
 of their civil rights and liberties, and their religion, when it is 
 incorporated with them; but it provides for the preservation of public 
 peace and order, by forbidding private persons, <I>qua tales--as 
 such,</I> to resist the powers that are; nay, we have a general precept 
 that we <I>resist not evil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:39"><I>ch.</I> v. 39</A>),

 nor will Christ have his ministers propagate his religion by force of 
 arms, <I>Religio cogi non potest; et defendenda non occidendo, sed 
 moriendo--Religion cannot be forced; and it should be defended, not by
 killing, but by dying.</I> Lactantii Institut. As Christ forbade his 
 disciples the sword of justice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:25,26"><I>ch.</I> xx. 25, 26</A>),

 so here the sword of war. Christ bade Peter put up his sword, and
 never bade him draw it again; yet that which Peter is here blamed for
 is his doing it unseasonably; the hour was come for Christ to suffer
 and die, he knew Peter knew it, the <I>sword of the Lord was drawn
 against him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:7">Zech. xiii. 7</A>),

 and for Peter to draw his sword for him, was like, <I>Master, spare
 thyself.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three reasons Christ give to Peter for this rebuke:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] His drawing the sword would be dangerous to himself and to his 
 fellow-disciples; <I>They that take the sword, shall perish with the 
 sword;</I> they that use violence, fall by violence; and men hasten and 
 increase their own troubles by blustering bloody methods of 
 self-defence. They that take the sword before it is given them, that 
 use it without warrant or call, expose themselves to the sword of war, 
 or public justice. Had it not been for the special care and providence 
 of the Lord Jesus, Peter and the rest of them had, for aught I know, 
 been cut in pieces immediately. Grotius gives another, and a probable 
 sense of this blow, making those that take the sword to be, not Peter, 
 but the officers and soldiers that come with swords <I>to take 
 Christ;</I> They shall <I>perish with the sword.</I> "Peter, thou 
 needest not draw they sword to punish them. God will certainly, 
 shortly, and severely, reckon with them." They took the Roman sword to 
 seize Christ with, and by the Roman sword, not long after, they and 
 their place and nation were destroyed. <I>Therefore</I> we must not 
 <I>avenge ourselves,</I> because <I>God will repay</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:19">Rom. xii. 19</A>);

 and therefore we must suffer with faith and patience, because
 persecutors will be paid in their own coin. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10">Rev. xiii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It was needless for him to draw his sword in defence of his
 Master, how, if he pleased, could summon into his service all the hosts
 of heaven 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>);

 "<I>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
 send</I> from heaven effectual succours? Peter, if I would put by these
 sufferings, I could easily do it without thy hand or thy sword." Note,
 God has no need of us, of our services, much less of our sins, to bring
 about his purposes; and it argues our distrust and disbelief of the
 power of Christ, when we go out of the way of our duty to serve his
 interests. God can do his work without us; if we look into the heavens,
 and see how he is attended there, we may easily infer, that, <I>though
 we be righteous,</I> he is not beholden to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:5,7">Job xxxv. 5, 7</A>.

 Though Christ was crucified through weakness, it was a voluntary
 weakness; he submitted to death, not because he could not, but because 
 he would not contend with it. This takes off the offence of the cross, 
 and proves Christ crucified the power of God; even now in the depth of 
 his sufferings he could call in the aid of legions of angels. 
 <I>Now,</I> <B><I>arti</I></B>--<I>yet;</I> "Though the business is so 
 far gone, I could yet with a word speaking turn the scale." Christ here 
 lets us know,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> What a great interest he had in his Father; <I>I can pray 
 to my Father, and he will send me help from the sanctuary.</I> I can 
 <B><I>parakalesai</I></B>--<I>demand of my Father these succours.</I>
 Christ prayer <I>as one having authority.</I> Note, It is a great 
 comfort to God's people, when they are surrounded with enemies on all 
 hands, that they have a way open heavenward; if they can do nothing 
 else, they can pray to him that can do every thing. And they who are 
 much in prayer at other times, have most comfort in praying when 
 troublesome times come. Observe, Christ saith, not only that God could 
 send him such a number of angels, but that, if he insisted upon it, he 
 would do it. Though he had undertaken the work of our redemption, yet, 
 if he had desired to be released, it should seem by this that the 
 Father would not have held him to it. He might yet have gone out free 
 from the service, but he loved it, and would not; so that it was only 
 with the cords of his own love that he was bound to the altar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> What a great interest he had in the heavenly hosts; 
 <I>He shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels,</I> 
 amounting to above seventy-two thousand. Observe here, 

 1. There is an <I>innumerable company of angels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb. xii. 2</A>.

 A detachment of more than twelve legions might be spared for our
 service, and yet there would be no miss of them about the throne. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:10">Dan. vii. 10</A>.

 They are marshalled in exact order, like the well-disciplined legions;
 not a confused multitude, but regular troops; all know their post, and 
 observe the word of command. 

 2. This innumerable company of angels are all at the disposal of our
 heavenly Father, and do his pleasure,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:20,21">Ps. ciii. 20, 21</A>.

 3. These angelic hosts were ready to come in to the assistance of our
 Lord Jesus in his sufferings, if he had needed or desired it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:6,14">Heb. i. 6, 14</A>.

 They would have been to him as they were to Elisha, <I>chariots of
 fire, and horses of fire,</I> not only to secure him, but to consume 
 those that set upon him. 

 4. Our heavenly Father is to be eyed and acknowledged in all the
 services of the heavenly hosts; <I>He shall give them me:</I> therefore 
 angels are not to be prayed to, but the Lord of the angels,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:11">Ps. xci. 11</A>.

 5. It is matter of comfort to all that wish well to the kingdom of
 Christ, that there is a world of angels always at the service of the 
 Lord Jesus, that can do wonders. He that has the armies of heaven at 
 his beck, can do what he pleases among the <I>inhabitants of the 
 earth;</I> He shall <I>presently</I> give them me. See how ready his 
 Father was to hear his prayer, and how ready the angels were to observe 
 his orders; they are willing servants, winged messengers, they <I>fly 
 swiftly.</I> This is very encouraging to those that have the honour of 
 Christ, and the welfare of his church, much at heart. Think they that 
 they have more care and concern for Christ and his church, than God and 
 the holy angels have?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] It was no time to make any defence at all, or to offer to put by 
 the stroke; <I>For how then shall the scripture be fulfilled, that thus 
 it must be?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 It was written, that Christ should be <I>led as a lamb to the 
 slaughter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:7">Isa. liii. 7</A>.

 Should he summon the angels to his assistance, he would not be led to 
 the slaughter at all; should he permit his disciples to fight, he would 
 not be led as a lamb quietly and without resistance; therefore he and 
 his disciples must yield to the accomplishment of the predictions. 
 Note, In all difficult cases, the word of God must be conclusive 
 against our own counsels, and nothing must be done, nothing attempted, 
 against the fulfilling of the scripture. If the easing of our pains, 
 the breaking of our bonds, the saving of our lives, will not consist 
 with the fulfilling of the scripture, we ought to say, "Let God's word 
 and will take place, let his law be magnified and made honourable, 
 whatever becomes of us." Thus Christ checked Peter, when he set up for 
 his champion, and captain of his life-guard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We are next told how Christ argued the case with them that came to 
 take him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>);

 though he did not resist them, yet he did reason with them. Note, It 
 will consist with Christian patience under our sufferings, calmly to 
 expostulate with our enemies and persecutors, as David with Saul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:14,26:18">1 Sam. xxiv. 14; xxvi. 18</A>.
 
 <I>Are ye come out,</I>

 (1.) With rage and enmity, <I>as against a thief,</I> as if I were an
 enemy to the public safety, and deservedly suffered this? Thieves draw 
 upon themselves the common odium; every one will lend a hand to stop a 
 thief: and thus they fell upon Christ as the offscouring of all things.
 If he had been the plague of his country, he could not have been 
 prosecuted with more heat and violence. 

 (2.) With all this power and force, as against the worst of thieves, 
 that dare the law, bid defiance to public justice, and add rebellion to 
 their sin? You are come out as against a thief, with swords and staves, 
 as if there were danger of resistance; whereas ye have <I>killed the 
 just One, and he doth not resist you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:6">Jam. v. 6</A>.

 If he had not been willing to suffer, it was folly to <I>come with
 swords and staves, for they could not conquer him;</I> had he been 
 minded to resist, he would have esteemed their iron as straw, and their 
 swords and staves would have been as briars before a consuming fire; 
 but, being willing to suffer, it was folly to come thus armed, for he 
 would not contend with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He further expostulates with them, by reminding them how he had behaved 
 himself hitherto toward them, and they toward him. 

 [1.] Of his public appearance; <I>I sat daily with you in the temple 
 teaching.</I> And, 

 [2.] Of their public connivance; <I>Ye laid no hold on me.</I> How 
 comes then this change? They were very unreasonable, in treating him as 
 they did. <I>First,</I> He had given them no occasion to look upon him 
 as a thief, for he had taught in the temple. And such were the matter, 
 and such the manner of his teaching, that he was manifested in the 
 consciences of all that heard him, not to be a bad man. Such gracious 
 words as came from his mouth, were not the words of a thief, nor of one 
 that had a devil. <I>Secondly,</I> Nor had he given them occasion to 
 look upon him as one that absconded, or fled from justice, that they 
 should come in the night to seize him; if they had any thing to say to 
 him, they might find him every day in the temple, ready to answer all 
 challenges, all charges, and there they might do as they pleased with 
 him; for the chief priests had the custody of the temple, and the 
 command of the guards about it; but to come upon him thus 
 clandestinely, in the place of his retirement, was base and cowardly.
 Thus the greatest hero may be villainously assassinated in a corner, by 
 one that in open field would tremble to look him in the face.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>But all this was done</I> (so it follows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>)

 <I>that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</I> It is 
 hard to say, whether these are the words of the sacred historian, as a 
 comment upon this story, and a direction to the Christian reader to 
 compare it with the scriptures of the Old Testament, which pointed at 
 it; or, whether they are the words of Christ himself, as a reason why, 
 though he could not but resent this base treatment, he yet submitted to 
 it, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled, to which he 
 had just now referred himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 Note, The scripture are in the fulfilling every day; and all those 
 scriptures which speak of the Messiah, had their full accomplishment in 
 our Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. How he was, in the midst of this distress, shamefully deserted by 
 his disciples; <I>They all forsook him, and fled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This was their sin; and it was a great sin for them who had left 
 all to follow him, now to leave him for they knew not what. There was 
 unkindness in it, considering the relation they stood in to him, the 
 favours they had received from him, and the melancholy circumstances he 
 was now in. There was unfaithfulness in it, for they had solemnly 
 promised to adhere to him, and never to forsake him. He had indented 
 for their safe conduct 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:8">John xviii. 8</A>);

 yet they could not rely upon that, but shifted for themselves by an 
 inglorious flight. What folly was this, for fear of death to flee from 
 him whom they themselves knew and had acknowledged to be the 
 <I>Fountain of life?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:67,68">John vi. 67, 68</A>.

 <I>Lord, what is man!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was a part of Christ's suffering, it added affliction to his 
 bonds, to be thus deserted, as it did to Job 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:13"><I>ch.</I> xix. 13</A>),

 <I>He hath put my brethren far from me;</I> and to David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:11">Ps. xxxviii. 11</A>),

 <I>Lovers and friends stand aloof from my sore.</I> They should have 
 staid with him, to minister to him, to countenance him, and, if need 
 were, to be witnesses for him at his trial; but they treacherously 
 deserted him, as, at St. Paul's <I>first answer, no man stood with 
 him.</I> But there was a mystery in this. 

 [1.] Christ, as a sacrifice for sins, stood thus abandoned. The deer 
 that by the keeper's arrow is marked out to be hunted and run down, is 
 immediately deserted by the whole herd. In this he was made a curse for 
 us, being left as one separated to evil. 

 [2.] Christ, as the Saviour of souls, stood thus alone; as he needed 
 not, so he had not the assistance of any other in working out our 
 salvation; he bore all, and did all himself. He <I>trod the wine-press 
 alone,</I> and when there was <I>none to uphold,</I> then <I>his own 
 arm wrought salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:3,5">Isa. lxiii. 3, 5</A>.

 So <I>the Lord alone did lead his Israel,</I> and they <I>stand still,
 and only see this great salvation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:12">Deut. xxxii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>57  And they that had laid hold on Jesus led <I>him</I> away to
 Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
 assembled.
 &nbsp; 58  But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's
 palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
 &nbsp; 59  Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council,
 sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
 &nbsp; 60  But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, <I>yet</I>
 found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
 &nbsp; 61  And said, This <I>fellow</I> said, I am able to destroy the
 temple of God, and to build it in three days.
 &nbsp; 62  And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
 nothing? what <I>is it which</I> these witness against thee?
 &nbsp; 63  But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and
 said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us
 whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 64  Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say
 unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the
 right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
 &nbsp; 65  Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath
 spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold,
 now ye have heard his blasphemy.
 &nbsp; 66  What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of
 death.
 &nbsp; 67  Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
 smote <I>him</I> with the palms of their hands,
 &nbsp; 68  Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote
 thee?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the arraignment of our Lord Jesus in the ecclesiastical
 court, before the great sanhedrim. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sitting of the court; the scribes and the elders were assembled, 
 though it was in the dead time of the night, when other people were 
 fast asleep in their beds; yet, to gratify their malice against Christ, 
 they denied themselves that natural rest, and sat up all night, to be 
 ready to fall upon the prey which Judas and his men, they hoped, would 
 <I>seize.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See, 

 1. Who they were, that were assembled; the <I>scribes,</I> the 
 principal teachers, and <I>elders,</I> the principal rulers, of the 
 Jewish church: these were the most bitter enemies to Christ our great 
 teacher and ruler, on whom therefore they had a jealous eye, as one 
 that eclipsed them; perhaps some of these scribes and elders were not 
 so malicious at Christ as some others of them were; yet, in concurrence 
 with the rest, they made themselves guilty. Now the scripture was 
 fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:16">Ps. xxii. 16</A>);

 <I>The assembly of the wicked have enclosed me.</I> Jeremiah complains 
 of an assembly of treacherous men; and David of his enemies 
 <I>gathering themselves together against him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:15">Ps. xxxv. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Where they were assembled; <I>in the palace of Caiaphas the High 
 Priest;</I> there they assembled two days before, to lay the plot 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and there they now convened again, to prosecute it. The <I>High 
 Priest</I> was <I>Ab-beth-din--the father of the house of judgment,</I> 
 but he is now the patron of wickedness; his house should have been the 
 sanctuary of oppressed innocency, but it is become the throne of 
 iniquity; and no wonder, when even God's house of prayer was made a den 
 of thieves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The setting of the prisoner to the bar; they that had <I>laid hold 
 on Jesus, led him away,</I> hurried him, no doubt, with violence, led 
 him as a trophy of their victory, led him as a victim to the altar; he 
 was brought into Jerusalem through that which was called the 
 <I>sheep-gate,</I> for that was the way into town from the mount of 
 Olives; and it was so called because the sheep appointed for sacrifice 
 were brought that way to the temple; very fitly therefore is Christ led 
 that way, who is the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world. 
 Christ was led first to the High Priest, for by the law all sacrifices 
 were to be first <I>presented to the priest, and delivered into his 
 hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:5">Lev. xvii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The cowardice and faint-heartedness of Peter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>);

 <I>But Peter followed afar off.</I> This comes in here, with an eye to 
 the following story of his denying him. He forsook him as the rest did, 
 when he was seized, and what is here said of his following him is 
 easily reconcilable with his forsaking him; such following was no 
 better than forsaking him; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He followed him, but it was <I>afar off.</I> Some sparks of love and 
 concern for his Master there were in his breast, and therefore he 
 followed him; but fear and concern for his own safety prevailed, and 
 therefore he followed afar off. Note, It looks ill, and bodes worse, 
 when those that are willing to be Christ's disciples, are not willing 
 to be known to be so. Here began Peter's denying him; for to follow him 
 afar off, is by little and little to go back from him. There is danger 
 in drawing back, nay, in looking back.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He followed him, but he <I>went in, and sat with the servants.</I> 
 He should have gone up to the court, and attended on his Master, and 
 appeared for him; but he went in where there was a good fire, and sat 
 with the servants, not to silence their reproaches, but to screen 
 himself. It was presumption in Peter thus to thrust himself into 
 temptation; he that does so, throws himself out of God's protection. 
 Christ had told Peter that he could not follow him now, and had 
 particularly warned him of his danger <I>this night;</I> and yet he 
 would venture into the midst of this wicked crew. It helped David to 
 walk in his integrity, that he <I>hated the congregation of evil doers, 
 and would not sit with the wicked.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He followed him, but it was only <I>to see the end,</I> led more by 
 his curiosity than by his conscience; he attended as an idle spectator 
 rather than as a disciple, a person concerned. He should have gone in, 
 to do Christ some service, or to get some wisdom and grace to himself, 
 by observing Christ's behaviour under his sufferings: but he went in, 
 only to look about him; it is not unlikely that Peter went in, 
 expecting that Christ would have made his escape miraculously out of 
 the hands of his persecutors; that, having so lately struck them down, 
 who came to seize him, he would now have struck them dead, who sat to 
 judge him; and this he had a mind to see: if so, it was folly for him 
 to think of seeing any other end than what Christ had foretold, that he 
 should be put to death. Note, It is more our concern to prepare for the 
 end, whatever it may be, than curiously to enquire what the end will 
 be. The event is God's, but the duty is ours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The trial of our Lord Jesus in this court.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They examined witnesses against him, though they were resolved, 
 right or wrong, to condemn him; yet, to put the better colour upon it, 
 they would produce evidence against him. The crimes properly cognizable 
 in their court, were, false doctrine and blasphemy; these they 
 endeavoured to prove upon him. And observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their search for proof; <I>They sought false witness against 
 him;</I> they had seized him, bound him, abused him, and after all have 
 to seek for something to lay to his charge, and can show no cause for 
 his commitment. They tried if any of them could allege seemingly from 
 their own knowledge any thing against him; and suggested one calumny 
 and then another, which, if true, might touch his life. Thus <I>evil 
 men dig up mischief,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:27">Prov. xvi. 27</A>.

 Here they trod in the steps of their predecessors, who <I>devised
 devices against Jeremiah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:18,20:10">Jer. xviii. 18; xx. 10</A>.

 They made proclamation, that, if any one could give information against 
 the prisoner at the bar, they were ready to receive it, and presently 
 many bore false witness against him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>);

 for is <I>a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked,</I> and
 will carry false stories to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:12">Prov. xxix. 12</A>.

 This is an evil often seen under the sun, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:5">Eccl. x. 5</A>.

 If Naboth must be taken off, there are sons of Belial to swear against 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their success in this search; in several attempts they were
 baffled, they sought false testimonies among themselves, others came in 
 to help them, and yet they found none; they could make nothing of it, 
 could not take the evidence together, or give it any colour of truth or 
 consistency with itself, no, not they themselves being judges. The 
 matters alleged were such palpable lies, as carried their own 
 confutation along with them. This redounded much to the honour of 
 Christ now, when they were loading him with disgrace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But at last they met with <I>two</I> witnesses, who, it seems, agreed 
 in their evidence, and therefore were hearkened to, in hopes that now 
 the point was gained. The words they swore against him, were, that he 
 should say, <I>I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it 
 in three days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>.
 
 Now by this they designed to accuse him,

 [1.] As an enemy to the temple, and one that sought for the destruction 
 of it, which they could not bear to hear of; for they valued themselves 
 by <I>the temple of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:4">Jer. vii. 4</A>),

 and, when they abandoned other idols, made a perfect idol of that.
 Stephen was accused for <I>speaking against this holy place,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:13,14">Acts vi. 13, 14</A>.

 [2.] As one that dealt in witchcraft, or some such unlawful arts, by
 the help of which he could rear such a building in three days: they had
 often suggested that he was in league with Beelzebub. Now, as to this,
 <I>First,</I> The words were mis-recited; he said, <I>Destroy ye this
 temple</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:19">John ii. 19</A>),

 plainly intimating that he spoke of a temple which his enemies would 
 seek to destroy; they come, and swear that he said, <I>I am able to 
 destroy</I> this temple, as if the design against it were his. He said, 
 <I>In Three days I will raise it up</I>--<B> <I>egero auton</I></B>, a 
 word properly used of a living temple; <I>I will raise it to life.</I> 
 They come, and swear that he said, <I>I am able,</I> 
 <B><I>oikodomesai</I></B>--<I>to build it;</I> which is properly used 
 of a house temple. <I>Secondly,</I> The words were misunderstood; <I>he 
 spoke of the temple of his body</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:21">John ii. 21</A>),

 and perhaps when he said, <I>this temple,</I> pointed to, or laid his 
 hand upon, his own body; but they swore that he said the <I>temple of 
 God,</I> meaning this holy place. Note, There have been, and still are, 
 such as <I>wrest</I> the sayings of Christ <I>to their own 
 destruction,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:16">2 Pet. iii. 16</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Make the worst they could of it, it was no capital
 crime, even by their own law; if it had been, no question but he had 
 been prosecuted for it, when he spoke the words in a public discourse 
 some years ago; nay, the words were capable of a laudable construction, 
 and such as bespoke a kindness for the temple; if it were destroyed, he 
 would exert himself to the utmost to rebuild it. But any thing that 
 looked criminal, would serve to give colour to their malicious 
 prosecution. Now the scriptures were fulfilled, which said, <I>False 
 witnesses are risen up against me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:12">Ps. xxvii. 12</A>);
 
 and see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:11">Ps. xxxv. 11</A>.

 <I>Though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against 
 me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:13">Hos. vii. 13</A>.
 
 We stand justly accused, the law <I>accuseth us,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:26,Joh+5:45">Deut. xxvii. 26; John v. 45</A>.
 
 Satan and our own consciences accuse us, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:20">1 John iii. 20</A>.

 The creatures cry out against us. Now, to discharge us from all these
 just accusations, our Lord Jesus submitted to this, to be unjustly and 
 falsely accused, that in the virtue of his sufferings we may be enabled 
 to triumph over all challenges; <I>Who shall lay any thing to the 
 charge of God's elect?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:33,34">Rom. viii. 33, 34</A>.

 He was accused, that he might not be condemned; and if at any time we
 suffer thus, have all manner of evil, not only said, but <I>sworn, 
 against us falsely,</I> let us remember that we cannot expect to fare 
 better than our Master.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Christ's silence under all these accusations, to the amazement of 
 the court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>.

 The High Priest, the judge of the court, arose in some heat, and said, 
 "<I>Answerest thou nothing?</I> Come, you the prisoner at the bar; you 
 hear what is sworn against you, what have you now to say for yourself? 
 What defence can you make? Or what please have you to offer in answer 
 to this charge?" <I>But Jesus held his peace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:63"><I>v.</I> 63</A>),

 not as one sullen, or as one self-condemned, or as one astonished and 
 in confusion; not because he wanted something to say, or knew not how 
 to say it, but that the scripture might be fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:7">Isa. liii. 7</A>);
 
 <I>As the sheep is dumb before the shearer,</I> and before the butcher, 
 <I>so he opened not his mouth;</I> and that he might be the Son of 
 David, who, when his enemies spoke mischievous things against him, was 
 <I>as a deaf man that heard not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:12-14">Ps. xxxviii. 12-14</A>.

 He was silent, because <I>his hour was come;</I> he would not deny the
 charge, because he was willing to submit to the sentence; otherwise, he 
 could as easily have put them to silence and shame now, as he had done 
 many a time before. If God had entered into judgment with us, we had 
 been <I>speechless</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:12"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 12</A>),

 not able to <I>answer for one of a thousand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:3">Job ix. 3</A>.

 Therefore, when Christ was <I>made sin for us,</I> he was silent, and
 left it to his blood to speak,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:24">Heb. xii. 24</A>.

 He stood mute at this bar, that we might have something to say at God's
 bar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Well, this way will not do; <I>ali&acirc; aggrediendum est
 vi&acirc;--recourse must be had to some other expedient.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They examined our Lord Jesus himself upon an oath like that <I>ex 
 officio;</I> and, since they could not accuse him, they will try, 
 contrary to the law of equity, to make him accuse himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is the interrogatory put to him by the High Priest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 [1.] The question itself; <I>Whether thou be the Christ, the Son of 
 God?</I> That is, Whether thou pretend to be so? For they will by no 
 means admit it into consideration, whether he be really so or no; 
 though the Messiah was to <I>be the Consolation of Israel,</I> and 
 glorious things were spoken concerning him in the Old Testament, yet so 
 strangely besotted were they with a jealousy of any thing that 
 threatened their exorbitant power and grandeur, that they would never 
 enter into the examination of the matter, whether Jesus was the Messiah 
 or no; never once put the case, suppose he should be so; they only 
 wished him to confess that he called himself so, that they might on 
 that indict him as a deceiver. What will not pride and malice carry men 
 to?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The solemnity of the proposal of it; <I>I adjure thee by the 
 living God, that thou tell us.</I> Not that he had any regard to the 
 living God, but took his name in vain; only thus he hoped to gain his 
 point with our Lord Jesus; "If thou hast any value for the blessed name 
 of God, and reverence for his Majesty, tell us this." If he should 
 refuse to answer when he was thus adjured, they would charge him with 
 contempt of the blessed name of God. Thus the persecutors of good men 
 often take advantage against them by their consciences, as Daniel's 
 enemies did against him in the matter of his God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ's answer to this interrogatory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:64"><I>v.</I> 64</A>),
 
 in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He owns himself to be <I>The Christ the Son of God. Thou hast 
 said;</I> that is, "It is as thou hast said;" for in St. Mark it is, 
 <I>I am.</I> Hitherto, he seldom professed himself expressly to be the 
 Christ, the Son of God; the tenour of his doctrine bespoke it, and his 
 miracles proved it: but now he would not omit to make a confession of 
 it, <I>First,</I> Because that would have looked like a disowning of 
 that truth which he came into the world to bear witness to. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> It would have looked like declining his sufferings, 
 when he knew the acknowledgment of this would give his enemies all the 
 advantage they desired against him. He thus confessed himself, for 
 example and encouragement to his followers, when they are called to it, 
 to <I>confess him before men,</I> whatever hazards they run by it. And 
 according to this pattern the martyrs readily confessed themselves 
 Christians, though they knew they must die for it, as the martyrs at 
 Thebais, <I>Euseb. Hist.</I> 50.8, 100.9. That Christ answered out of a
 regard to the adjuration which Caiaphas had profanely used by the 
 <I>living God,</I> I cannot think, any more than that he had any regard 
 to the like adjuration in the devil's mouth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:7">Mark v. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He refers himself, for the proof of this, to his second coming, 
 and indeed to his whole estate of exaltation. It is probable that they 
 looked upon him with a scornful disdainful smile, when he said, "<I>I 
 am;</I>" "A likely fellow," thought they, "to be the Messiah, who is 
 expected to come in so much pomp and power;" and to that this 
 <I>nevertheless</I> refers. "Though now you see me in this low and 
 abject state, and think it a ridiculous thing for me to call myself the 
 Messiah, <I>nevertheless</I> the day is coming when I shall appear 
 otherwise." <I>Hereafter,</I> <B><I>ap arti</I></B>--<I>&agrave; 
 modo--shortly;</I> for his exaltation began in a few days; now shortly 
 his kingdom began to be set up; and <I>hereafter ye shall see the Son 
 of man sitting on the right hand of power, to judge the world;</I> of 
 which his coming shortly to judge and destroy the Jewish nation would 
 be a type and earnest. Note, The terrors of the judgment-day will be a 
 sensible conviction to the most obstinate infidelity, not in order to 
 conversion (that will be then too late), but in order to an eternal 
 confusion. Observe, <I>First,</I> Whom they should see; <I>the Son of 
 man.</I> Having owned himself the Son of God, even now in his estate of 
 humiliation, he speaks of himself as the Son of man, even in his estate 
 of exaltation; for he had these two distinct natures in one person. The 
 incarnation of Christ has made him Son of God and Son of man; for he is 
 <I>Immanuel,</I> God with us. <I>Secondly,</I> In what posture they
 should see him; 

 1. <I>Sitting on the right hand of power,</I> according to the prophecy
 of the Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>);

 <I>Sit thou at my right hand;</I> which denotes both the dignity and 
 the dominion he is exalted to. Though now he stood at the bar, they 
 should shortly see him sit on the throne. 

 2. <I>Coming in the clouds of heaven;</I> this refers to another
 prophecy concerning the <I>Son of man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13,14">Dan. vii. 13, 14</A>),

 which is applied to Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:33">Luke i. 33</A>),

 when he came to destroy Jerusalem; so terrible was the judgment, and so 
 sensible the indications of the wrath of the Lamb in it, that it might 
 be called <I>a visible appearance of Christ;</I> but doubtless it has 
 reference to the general judgment; to this day he appeals, and summons 
 them to an appearance, then and there to answer for what they are now 
 doing. He had spoken of this day to his disciples, awhile ago, for 
 their comfort, and had bid them <I>lift up their heads</I> for joy in 
 the prospect of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:27,28">Luke xxi. 27, 28</A>.

 Now he speaks of it to his enemies, for their terror; for nothing is
 more comfortable to the righteous, nor more terrible to the wicked, 
 than Christ's judging the world at the last day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His conviction upon this trial; <I>The High Priest rent his 
 clothes,</I> according to the custom of the Jews, when they heard or 
 saw any thing done or said, which they looked upon to be a reproach to 
 God; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:22,37:1,Ac+14:14">Isa. xxxvi. 22; xxxvii. 1;
 Acts xiv. 14</A>.

 Caiaphas would be thought extremely tender of the glory of God 
 (<I>Come, see his zeal for the Lord of hosts</I>); but, while he 
 pretended an abhorrence of blasphemy, he was himself the greatest 
 blasphemer; he now forgot the law which forbade the High Priest in any 
 case to rend his clothes, unless we will suppose this an excepted 
 case.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. The crime he was found guilty of; <I>blasphemy. He hath spoken 
 blasphemy;</I> that is, he hath spoken reproachfully of the living God; 
 that is the notion we have of blasphemy; because we by sin had
 reproached the Lord, therefore Christ, when <I>he was made Sin for 
 us,</I> was condemned as a blasphemer for the truth he told them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The evidence upon which they found him guilty; <I>Ye have heard the 
 blasphemy;</I> why should we trouble ourselves to examine 
 <I>witnesses</I> any further? He owned the fact, that he did profess 
 himself the <I>Son of God;</I> and then they made blasphemy of it, and 
 convicted him upon his confession. The High Priest triumphs in the 
 success of the snare he had laid; "Now I think I have done his business 
 for him." <I>Aha, so would we have it.</I> Thus was he <I>judged out of 
 his own mouth</I> at their bar, because we were liable to be so judged 
 at God's bar. There is no need of witnesses against us; our own 
 consciences are against us instead of a thousand witnesses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. His sentence passed, upon this conviction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:66"><I>v.</I> 66</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. Caiaphas's appeal to the bench; <I>What think ye?</I> See his base 
 hypocrisy and partiality; when he had already prejudged the cause, and 
 pronounced him a blasphemer, then, as if he were willing to be advised, 
 he asks the judgment of his brethren; but hide malice ever so cunningly 
 under the robe of justice, some way or other it will break out. If he 
 would have dealt fairly, he should have collected the votes of the 
 bench <I>seriatim--in order,</I> and begun with the junior, and
 delivered his own opinion last; but he knew that by the authority of 
 his place he could sway the rest, and therefore declares his judgment, 
 and presumes they are all of his mind; he takes the crime, with regard 
 to Christ, <I>pro confesso--as a crime confessed;</I> and the judgment,
 with regard to the court, <I>pro concesso--as a judgment agreed
 to.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their concurrence with him; they said, <I>He is guilty of death;</I> 
 perhaps they did not all concur: it is certain that Joseph of 
 Arimathea, if he was present, dissented 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:51">Luke xxiii. 51</A>);

 so did Nicodemus, and, it is likely, others with them; however, the 
 majority carried it that way; but, perhaps, this being an extraordinary 
 council, or cabal rather, none had notice to be present but such as 
 they knew would concur, and so it might be voted <I>nemine 
 contradicente--unanimously.</I> The judgment was, "<I>He is guilty of 
 death;</I> by the law he deserves to die." Though they had not power 
 now to put any man to death, yet by such a judgment as this they made a 
 man an <I>outlaw</I> among his people (<I>qui caput gerit lupinum--he 
 carries a wolf's head;</I> so our old law describes an outlaw), and so 
 exposed him to the fury either of a popular tumult, as Stephen was, or 
 to be clamoured against before the governor, as Christ was. Thus was 
 the Lord of life condemned to die, that through him there may be <I>no 
 condemnation to us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The abuses and indignities done to him after sentence passed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:67,68"><I>v.</I> 67, 68</A>);

 <I>Then,</I> when he was found guilty, they <I>spat in his face.</I> 
 Because they had not power to put him to death, and could not be sure 
 that they should prevail with the governor to be their executioner, 
 they would do him all the mischief they could, now that they had him in 
 their hands. Condemned prisoners are taken under the special protection 
 of the law, which they are to make satisfaction to, and by all 
 civilized nations have been treated with tenderness; sufficient is this 
 punishment. But when they had passed sentence upon our Lord Jesus, he 
 was treated as if hell had broken loose upon him, as if he were not 
 only <I>worthy of death,</I> but as if that were too good for him, and 
 he were unworthy of the compassion shown to the worst malefactors. Thus 
 <I>he was made a curse for us.</I> But who were they that were thus 
 barbarous? It should seem, the very same that had passed sentence upon 
 him. <I>They said, He is guilty of death, and then did they spit in his 
 face.</I> The priests began, and then no wonder if the servants, who 
 would do any thing to make sport to themselves, and curry favour with 
 their wicked masters, carried on the humour. See how they abused 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>They spat in his face.</I> Thus the scripture was fulfilled 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:6">Isa. l. 6</A>),

 <I>He hid not his face from shame and spitting.</I> Job complained of 
 this indignity done to him, and herein was a type of Christ 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:10">Job xxxi. 10</A>);

 <I>They spare not to spit in my face.</I> It is an expression of the 
 greatest contempt and indignation possible; looking upon him as more 
 despicable than the very ground they spit upon. When Miriam was under 
 the leprosy, it was looked upon as a disgrace to her, like that of 
 <I>her father spitting in her face,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:14">Num. xii. 14</A>.

 He that refused to raise up seed to his brother, was to undergo this 
 dishonour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:9">Deut. xxv. 9</A>.

 Yet Christ, when he was repairing the decays of the great family of
 mankind, submitted to it. That face which was <I>fairer than the 
 children of men,</I> which was <I>white and ruddy,</I> and which angels 
 reverence, was thus filthily abused by the basest and vilest of the 
 children of men. Thus was confusion poured upon his face, that ours 
 might not be filled with everlasting shame and contempt. They who now 
 profane his blessed name, abuse his word, and hate his image in his 
 sanctified ones; what do they better than spit in his face? They would 
 do that, if it were in their reach.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>They buffeted him, and smote him with the palms of their 
 hands.</I> This added pain to the shame, for both came in with sin. Now 
 the scripture was fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:6">Isa. l. 6</A>),

 <I>I gave my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; and</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:30">Lam. iii. 30</A>),

 <I>He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him; he is filled with
 reproach,</I> and yet <I>keepeth silence</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);
 
 and

 <I>They shall smite the Judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek;</I> 
 here the margin reads it, <I>They smote him with rods;</I> for so 
 <B><I>errapisan</I></B> signifies, and this he submitted to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They challenged him to tell who struck him, having first blindfolded 
 him; <I>Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?</I> 
 
 (1.) They made sport of him, as the Philistines did with Samson; it is 
 grievous to those that are in misery, for people to make merry 
 <I>about</I> them, but much more to make merry <I>with</I> them and 
 their misery. Here was an instance of the greatest depravity and 
 degeneracy of the human nature that could be, to show that there was 
 need of a religion that should recover men to humanity. 

 (2.) They made sport with his prophetical office. They had heard him 
 called a <I>prophet,</I> and that he was famed for wonderful 
 discoveries; this they upbraided him with, and pretended to make a 
 trial of; as if the divine omniscience must stoop to a piece of 
 children's play. <I>They</I> put a like affront upon Christ, who
 profanely jest with the scripture, and make themselves merry with holy 
 things; like Belshazzar's revels in the temple bowls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>69  Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto
 him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
 &nbsp; 70  But he denied before <I>them</I> all, saying, I know not what
 thou sayest.
 &nbsp; 71  And when he was gone out into the porch, another <I>maid</I> saw
 him, and said unto them that were there, This <I>fellow</I> was also
 with Jesus of Nazareth.
 &nbsp; 72  And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
 &nbsp; 73  And after a while came unto <I>him</I> they that stood by, and
 said to Peter, Surely thou also art <I>one</I> of them; for thy speech
 bewrayeth thee.
 &nbsp; 74  Then began he to curse and to swear, <I>saying,</I> I know not
 the man. And immediately the cock crew.
 &nbsp; 75  And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
 Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out,
 and wept bitterly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of Peter's denying his Master, and it comes in 
 as a part of Christ's sufferings. Our Lord Jesus was now in the High 
 Priest's hall, not to be tried, but baited rather; and then it would 
 have been some comfort to him to see his friends near him. But we do 
 not find any friend he had about the court, save Peter only, and it 
 would have been better if he had been at a distance. Observe how he 
 fell, and how he got up again by repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His sin, which is here impartially related, to the honour of the 
 penmen of scripture, who dealt faithfully. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The immediate occasion of Peter's sin. He sat without in the palace, 
 among the servants of the High Priest. Note, Bad company is to many an 
 occasion of sin; and those who needlessly thrust themselves into it, go 
 upon the devil's ground, venture into his crowds, and may expect either 
 to be tempted and ensnared, as Peter was, or to be ridiculed and 
 abused, as his Master was; they scarcely can come out of such company, 
 without guilt or grief, or both. He that would keep God's commandments 
 and his own covenant, must say to evil-doers, <I>Depart from me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:115">Ps. cxix. 115</A>.

 Peter spoke from his own experience, when he warned his new converts to
 <I>save themselves from that untoward generation;</I> for he had like 
 to have ruined himself by but going once among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The temptation to it. He was challenged as a retainer to Jesus of 
 Galilee. First one maid, and then another, and then the rest of the 
 servants, charged it upon him; <I>Thou also wert with Jesus of 
 Galilee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:69"><I>v.</I> 69</A>.

 And again, <I>This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:71"><I>v.</I> 71</A>.
 
 And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:73"><I>v.</I> 73</A>),

 <I>Thou also art one of them, for thy speech betrayeth thee</I> to be a 
 Galilean; whose dialect and pronunciation differed from that of the 
 other Jews. Happy he whose speech betrays him to be a disciple of 
 Christ, by the holiness and seriousness of whose discourse it appears 
 that he has been with Jesus! Observe how scornfully they speak of
 Christ-Jesus <I>of Galilee,</I> and <I>of Nazareth,</I> upbraiding him 
 with the country he was of: and how disdainfully they speak of 
 Peter--<I>This fellow;</I> as if they thought it a reproach to them to 
 have such a man in their company, and he was well enough served for 
 coming among them; yet they had nothing to accuse him of, but that he 
 was with Jesus, which, they thought, was enough to render him both a 
 scandalous and a suspected person.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The sin itself. When he was charged as one of Christ's disciples, he 
 denied it, was ashamed and afraid to own himself so, and would have all 
 about him to believe that he had no knowledge of him, nor any kindness 
 or concern for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Upon the first mention of it, he said, <I>I know not what thou 
 sayest.</I> This was a shuffling answer; he pretended that he did not 
 understand the charge, that he knew not whom she meant by <I>Jesus of 
 Galilee,</I> or what she meant by being <I>with</I> him; so making 
 strange of that which his heart was now as full of as it could be. 

 [1.] It is a fault thus to misrepresent our own apprehensions, 
 thoughts, and affections, to serve a turn; to pretend that we do not 
 understand, or did not think of, or remember, that which yet we do 
 apprehend, and did think of, and remember; this is a species of lying 
 which we are more prone to than any other, because in this a man is not 
 easily disproved; for <I>who knows the spirit of a man, save 
 himself?</I> But God knows it, and we must be restrained from this 
 wickedness by a fear of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:12">Prov. xxiv. 12</A>.

 [2.] It is yet a greater fault to be shy of Christ, to dissemble our
 knowledge of him, and to shift off a confession of him, when we are 
 called to it; it is, in effect, to <I>deny</I> him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Upon the next attack, he said, flat and plain, <I>I know not the 
 man,</I> and backed it with an oath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:72"><I>v.</I> 72</A>.

 This was, in effect, to say, I will not own him, I am no Christian; for 
 Christianity is the knowledge of Christ. Why, Peter? Canst thou look 
 upon yonder Prisoner at the bar, and say thou dost not know him? Didst 
 not thou quit all to follow him? And hast thou not been the man of his 
 counsel? Hast thou not known him better than any one else? Didst thou 
 not confess him to be the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? Hast thou 
 forgotten all the kind and tender looks thou hast had from him, and all 
 the intimate fellowship thou hast had with him? Canst thou look him in 
 the face, and say that thou dost not know him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Upon the third assault, <I>he began to curse and to swear, saying, 
 I know not the man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:74"><I>v.</I> 74</A>.

 This was worst of all, for the way of sin is down-hill. He cursed and 
 swore,

 [1.] To back what he said, and to gain credit to it, that they might
 not any more call it in question; he did not only <I>say</I> it, but 
 <I>swear</I> it; and yet what he said, was false. Note, We have reason 
 to suspect the truth of that which is backed with rash oaths and 
 imprecations. None but the devil's sayings need the devil's proofs. He 
 that will not be restrained by the third commandment from mocking his 
 God, will not be kept by the ninth from deceiving his brother. 

 [2.] He designed it to be an evidence for him, that he was none of 
 Christ's disciples, for this was none of their language. Cursing and 
 swearing suffice to prove a man no disciple of Christ; for it is the 
 language of his enemies thus to <I>take his name in vain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is written for warning to us, that we sin not after the similitude 
 of Peter's transgression; that we never, either directly or indirectly, 
 deny Christ the Lord that bought us, by rejecting his offers, resisting 
 his Spirit, dissembling our knowledge of him, and being ashamed of him 
 and his words, or afraid of suffering for him and with his suffering 
 people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The aggravations of this sin, which it may be of use to take notice 
 of, that we may observe the like transgressions in our own sins. 
 Consider, 

 (1.) Who he was: an apostle, one of the first three, that had been upon 
 all occasions the most forward to speak to the honour of Christ. The 
 greater profession we make of religion, the greater is our sin if in 
 any thing we walk unworthily. 

 (2.) What fair warning his Master had given him of his danger; if he 
 had regarded this as he ought to have done, he would not have run 
 himself into the temptation. 

 (3.) How solemnly he had promised to adhere to Christ in this night of 
 trial; he had said again and again, "<I>I will never deny thee;</I> no, 
 I will die with thee first;" yet he broke these bonds in sunder, and 
 his word was yea and nay. 

 (4.) How soon he fell into this sin after the Lord's supper. There to 
 receive such an inestimable pledge of redeeming love, and yet the same 
 night, before morning, to disown his Redeemer, was indeed <I>turning 
 aside quickly.</I> 

 (5.) How weak comparatively the temptation was; it was not the judge, 
 nor any of the officers of the court, that charged him with being a 
 disciple of Jesus, but a silly maid or two, that probably designed him 
 no hurt, nor would have done him any if he had owned it. This was but
 <I>running with the footmen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:5">Jer. xii. 5</A>.

 (6.) How often he repeated it; even after the cock had crowed once he
 continued in the temptation, and a second and third time relapsed into 
 the sin. Is this Peter? <I>How art thou fallen!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus was his sin aggravated; but on the other hand there is this to 
 extenuate it, that, what he said he said <I>in his haste,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:11">Ps. cxvi. 11</A>.

 He fell into the sin by surprise, not as Judas, with design; his heart
 was against it; he spoke very ill, but it was unadvisedly, and before 
 he was aware.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Peter's repentance for this sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:75"><I>v.</I> 75</A>.

 The former is written for our admonition, that we may not sin; but, if 
 at any time we be overtaken, this is written for our imitation, that we 
 may make haste to repent. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What it was, that brought Peter to repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>The cock crew</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:74"><I>v.</I> 74</A>);

 a common contingency; but, Christ having mentioned the crowing of 
 <I>the cock</I> in the warning he gave him, that made it a means of 
 bringing him to himself. The word of Christ can put a significancy upon 
 whatever sign he shall please to choose, and by virtue of that word he 
 can make it very beneficial to the souls of his people. The crowing of 
 a cock is to Peter instead of a John Baptist, the voice of one calling 
 to repentance. Conscience should be to us as the crowing of the cock, 
 to put us in mind of what we had forgotten. When <I>David's heart smote 
 him</I> the cock crew. Where there is a living principle of grace in 
 the soul, though for the present overpowered by temptation, a little 
 hint will serve, only for a memorandum, when God sets in with it, to 
 recover it from a by-path. Here was the crowing of a cock made a happy
 occasion of the conversion of a soul. Christ comes sometimes in mercy 
 <I>at cock-crowing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>He remembered the words of the Lord;</I> this was it that 
 brought him to himself, and melted him into tears of godly sorrow; a 
 sense of his ingratitude to Christ, and the slight regard he had had to 
 the gracious warning Christ had given him. Note, A serious reflection
 upon the words of the Lord Jesus will be a powerful inducement to 
 repentance, and will help to break the heart for sin. Nothing grieves a 
 penitent more than that he has sinned against the grace of the Lord 
 Jesus and the tokens of his love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How his repentance was expressed; <I>He went out, and wept 
 bitterly.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His sorrow was secret; he went out, out of the High Priest's hall, 
 vexed at himself that ever he came into it, now that he found what a 
 snare he was in, and got out of it as fast as he could. He went out 
 into the porch before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:71"><I>v.</I> 71</A>);

 and if he had gone quite off then, his second and third denial had been 
 prevented; but then he came in again, now he went out and came in no 
 more. He went out to some place of solitude and retirement, where he 
 might <I>bemoan</I> himself, <I>like the doves of the valleys,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:16,Jer+9:1,2">Ezek. vii. 16; Jer. ix. 1, 2</A>.

 He went out, that he might not be disturbed in his devotions on this
 sad occasion. We may <I>then</I> be most free in our communion with 
 God, when we are most free from the converse and business of this 
 world. In mourning for sin, we find <I>the families apart, and their 
 wives apart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:11,12">Zech. xii. 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His sorrow was serious; <I>He wept bitterly.</I> Sorrow for sin 
 must not be slight, but great and deep, like that for an only son. 
 Those that have sinned sweetly, must weep bitterly; for, sooner or 
 later, sin will be bitterness. This deep sorrow is requisite, not to 
 satisfy divine justice (a sea of tears would not do that), but to 
 evidence that there is a real change of mind, which is the essence of
 repentance, to make the pardon the more welcome, and sin for the future 
 the more loathsome. Peter, who wept so bitterly for denying Christ, 
 never denied him again, but <I>confessed</I> him often and openly, and 
 in the mouth of danger; so far from ever saying, <I>I know not the 
 man,</I> that he made all the house of <I>Israel know assuredly that 
 this same Jesus was Lord and Christ.</I> True repentance for any sin 
 will be best evidenced by our abounding in the contrary grace and duty; 
 that is a sign of our weeping, not only bitterly, but sincerely. Some 
 of the ancients say, that as long as Peter lived, he never heard a cock 
 crow but it set him a weeping. Those that have truly sorrowed for sin, 
 will sorrow upon every remembrance of it; yet not so as to hinder, but 
 rather to increase, their joy in God and in his mercy and grace.</P>
