    "body": "December 30th\nEvening Reading\n\n\"Knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?\"\n- 2 Samuel 2:26\n\nIf, O my reader! thou art merely a professor, and not a possessor of the faith that is in Christ Jesus, the following lines are a true ketch of thine end.\n\nYou are a respectable attendant at a place of worship; you go because others go, not because your heart is right with God.\n\nThis is your beginning.\n\nI will suppose that for the next twenty or thirty years you will be spared to go on as you do now, professing religion by an outward attendance upon the means of grace, but having no heart in the matter.\n\nTread softly, for I must show you the deathbed of such a one as yourself.\n\nLet us gaze upon him gently.\n\nA clammy sweat is on his brow, and he wakes up crying,\"O God, it is hard to die.\n\nDid you send for my minister?\"\"Yes, he is coming.\" The minister comes.\"Sir, I fear that I am dying!\"\"Have you any hope?\"\"I cannot say that I have.\n\nI fear to stand before my God; oh! pray for me.\" The prayer is offered for him with sincere earnestness, and the way of salvation is for the ten — thousandth time put before him, but before he has grasped the rope, I see him sink.\n\nI may put my finger upon those cold eyelids, for they will never see anything here again.\n\nBut where is the man, and where are the man's true eyes?\n\nIt is written,\"In hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torment.\" Ah! why did he not lift up his eyes before?\n\nBecause he was so accustomed to hear the gospel that his soul slept under it.\n\nAlas! if you should lift up your eyes there, how bitter will be your wailings.\n\nLet the Saviour's own words reveal the woe:\"Father Abraham, send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.\" There is a frightful meaning in those words.\n\nMay you never have to spell it out by the red light of Jehovah's wrath!"

    "keyverse": "\"John 7:37\nRivers of Living Water\nOn the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.\" — John 7:37",
    "body": "December 31st\nMorning Reading\n\n\"In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, if any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.\"\n- John 7:37\n\nPatience had her perfect work in the Lord Jesus, and until the last day of the feast He pleaded with the Jews, even as on this last day of the year He pleads with us, and waits to be gracious to us.\n\nAdmirable indeed is the longsuffering of the Saviour in bearing with some of us year after year, notwithstanding our provocations, rebellions, and resistance of His Holy Spirit.\n\nWonder of wonders that we are still in the land of mercy!\n\nPity expressed herself most plainly, for Jesus cried, which implies not only the loudness of His voice, but the tenderness of His tones.\n\nHe entreats us to be reconciled.\"We pray you,\" says the Apostle,\"as though God did beseech you by us.\" What earnest, pathetic terms are these!\n\nHow deep must be the love which makes the Lord weep over sinners, and like a mother woo His children to His bosom!\n\nSurely at the call of such a cry our willing hearts will come.\n\nProvision is made most plenteously; all is provided that man can need to quench his soul's thirst.\n\nTo his conscience the atonement brings peace; to his understanding the gospel brings the richest instruction; to his heart the person of Jesus is the noblest object of affection; to the whole man the truth as it is in Jesus supplies the purest nutriment.\n\nThirst is terrible, but Jesus can remove it.\n\nThough the soul were utterly famished, Jesus could restore it.\n\nProclamation is made most freely, that every thirsty one is welcome.\n\nNo other distinction is made but that of thirst.\n\nWhether it be the thirst of avarice, ambition, pleasure, knowledge, or rest, he who suffers from it is invited.\n\nThe thirst may be bad in itself, and be no sign of grace, but rather a mark of inordinate sin longing to be gratified with deeper draughts of lust; but it is not goodness in the creature which brings him the invitation, the Lord Jesus sends it freely, and without respect of persons.\n\nPersonality is declared most fully.\n\nThe sinner must come to Jesus, not to works, ordinances, or doctrines, but to a personal Redeemer, who His own self bare our sins in His own body on the tree.\n\nThe bleeding, dying, rising Saviour, is the only star of hope to a sinner.\n\nOh for grace to come now and drink, ere the sun sets upon the year's last day!\n\nNo waiting or preparation is so much as hinted at.\n\nDrinking represents a reception for which no fitness is required.\n\nA fool, a thief, a harlot can drink; and so sinfulness of character is no bar to the invitation to believe in Jesus.\n\nWe want no golden cup, no bejewelled chalice, in which to convey the water to the thirsty; the mouth of poverty is welcome to stoop down and quaff the flowing flood.\n\nBlistered, leprous, filthy lips may touch the stream of divine love; they cannot pollute it, but shall themselves be purified.\n\nJesus is the fount of hope.\n\nDear reader, hear the dear Redeemer's loving voice as He cries to each of us,\"If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.\""

    "body": "December 31st\nEvening Reading\n\n\"The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.\"\n- Jeremiah 8:20\n\nNot saved!\n\nDear reader, is this your mournful plight?\n\nWarned of the judgment to come, bidden to escape for your life, and yet at this moment not saved!\n\nYou know the way of salvation, you read it in the Bible, you hear it from the pulpit, it is explained to you by friends, and yet you neglect it, and therefore you are not saved.\n\nYou will be without excuse when the Lord shall judge the quick and dead.\n\nThe Holy Spirit has given more or less of blessing upon the word which has been preached in your hearing, and times of refreshing have come from the divine presence, and yet you are without Christ.\n\nAll these hopeful seasons have come and goneyour summer and your harvest have pastand yet you are not saved.\n\nYears have followed one another into eternity, and your last year will soon be here: youth has gone, manhood is going, and yet you are not saved.\n\nLet me ask youwill you ever be saved Is there any likelihood of it?\n\nAlready the most propitious seasons have left you unsaved; will other occasions alter your condition?\n\nMeans have failed with youthe best of means, used perseveringly and with the utmost affectionwhat more can be done for you?\n\nAffliction and prosperity have alike failed to impress you; tears and prayers and sermons have been wasted on your barren heart.\n\nAre not the probabilities dead against your ever being saved?\n\nIs it not more than likely that you will abide as you are till death for ever bars the door of hope?\n\nDo you recoil from the supposition?\n\nYet it is a most reasonable one: he who is not washed in so many waters will in all probability go filthy to his end.\n\nThe convenient time never has come, why should it ever come?\n\nIt is logical to fear that it never will arrive, and that Felix like, you will find no convenient season till you are in hell.\n\nO bethink you of what that hell is, and of the dread probability that you will soon be cast into it!\n\nReader, suppose you should die unsaved, your doom no words can picture.\n\nWrite out your dread estate in tears and blood, talk of it with groans and gnashing of teeth: you will be punished with everlasting destruction from the glory of the Lord, and from the glory of His power.\n\nA brother's voice would fain startle you into earnestness.\n\nO be wise, be wise in time, and ere another year begins, believe in Jesus, who is able to save to the uttermost.\n\nConsecrate these last hours to lonely thought, and if deep repentance be bred in you, it will be well; and if it lead to a humble faith in Jesus, it will be best of all.\n\nO see to it that this year pass not away, and you an unforgiven spirit.\n\nLet not the new year's midnight peals sound upon a joyless spirit!\n\nNow, NOW, NOW believe, and live.\"Escape for thy life; Look not behind thee, Neither stay thou In all the plain; Escape to the mountain, Lest thou be consumed.\""
